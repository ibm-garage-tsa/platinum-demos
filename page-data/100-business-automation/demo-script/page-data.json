Dashboards can be designed and shared in minutes that provide insight into important business activities and processes. You can prepare, track, and design visualizations of metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other measurements of business performance in customizable dashboards. <br/> <br/> Additionally, the historical data can be used to feed a data lake to apply machine learning to our automations. For example, to make even more sophisticated refund decisions, we could use a data lake to incorporate machine learning into our refund process. The Cloud Pak for Business Automation includes some machine learning samples to help you get started. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>3 - Modeling decisions</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Review the refund approval decision model** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Let’s look at how the business analyst can create and manage business rules to further increase straight-through processing.

Dashboards can be designed and shared in minutes that provide insight into important business activities and processes. You can prepare, track, and design visualizations of metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other measurements of business performance in customizable dashboards. <br/> <br/> Additionally, the historical data can be used to feed a data lake to apply machine learning to our automations. For example, to make even more sophisticated refund decisions, we could use a data lake to incorporate machine learning into our refund process. The Cloud Pak for Business Automation includes some machine learning samples to help you get started. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>3 - Modeling decisions</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Review the refund approval decision model** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Let’s look at how the business analyst can create and manage business rules to further increase straight-through processing.
