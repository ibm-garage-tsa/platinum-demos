The various anomalies represent real world performance issues that applications typically face like high CPU usage, memory leaks, or network congestion. <br/><br/> Now, let's examine the current state of the Quote of the Day application and understand the impact of the failures. Observe the increase in the number of calls, the error rate, increasing latency, and CPU processing time. <br/><br/> In the Top Services chart, notice the higher response times of the qotd-ratings service with respect to the other services. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Navigate back to the **Instana** Tab.

This includes recommendations for how to resolve the incident. We can take action directly from the notification and resolve the incident quickly. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.3** | **Review the golden signals of Quote of the Day** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Getting notified of an emerging problem via ChatOps</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **AIOps packages the notification along with relevant details as a story** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Notifications are now appearing in Slack. We’re using Slack in this demo, but Watson AIOps also integrates with Microsoft Teams. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps formats the notifications into a “story” using AI to correlate events, metrics, alerts, and logs. Each story brings together the various notifications for all the affected services by the same underlying issue. Imagine if each piece of data presented in the story was a separate notification – we’d quickly be inundated with alerts. <br/><br/> The story is like a home base for action when a problem arises. Instead of manually correlating things across multiple different tools, it’s all right here immediately when the notification is received. <br/><br/> In addition to providing a highly contextualized view of the incident, it enables us to jump to other tools to explore further details. This eliminates tool silos and helps us restore service faster.<br/><br/>This story is telling us there’s a problem with the Rating service, which is one of the microservices in our Quote of the Day application. <br/><br/> In the background, the AI has done the work for us. It shows which services are affected and presents us with a curated view of relevant information: the events and alerts that are indicative of the symptoms of this problem, anomalies that Watson AIOps has found in the log files, and similar incidents that have occurred in the past so we can see how they were successfully resolved. We’ll explore each of these components in more detail. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | The story starts showing up in Slack. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/13.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | When this story first appeared, the only affected service was the Rating service.<br/><br/>Watson AIOps updates the stories in real time as more information comes in and gets correlated to this story. <br/><br/>So now we can see that in addition to the Rating service, the Web service is also affected. This is now even more critical since the Web service is the customer-facing front end of the application, and we need to ensure that users can still access the app.<br/><br/>We need to find the root cause and fix this problem as quickly as possible. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Additional affected services are added to the story. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/14.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Take ownership of the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Understanding the AIOps generated story</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Analyze the notifications to learn about the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We need to find out where the issue began, so we can prevent it from causing cascading failures across the components of the application. <br/><br/> Instead of having to hop between tools to look for alerts, we can see them right here from the notification. Watson AIOps has determined that these events are related, and it provides an explanation for how it determined the relationships. We can see that there are two groups of events based on related resources and the timing of the events. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Scroll to the **View alert details** section of the story. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/15.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can inspect the grouped events right here, without searching for them in another tool.<br/><br/>It looks like the memory and CPU on the Rating service increased significantly. This is causing a significant slowdown in the response times on both the Rating and Web services.<br/><br/>Based on this information, it seems that the Rating service is the source of the issue. But let’s get a bit more detail – this time from the log files. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click the **View relevant events** button at the bottom of the notification. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/view-relevant-events.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | A pop-up will appear with the grouped events. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/relevant-events-alerts.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Instead of needing to go to Kibana and manually sort through the hundreds or thousands of log entries that come in every minute, Watson AIOps has found several anomalies in the log files and presented them here. It trains on the log files of the application when it’s operating normally, and it continually monitors for deviations from that baseline. We can see that the anomalies are occurring on the Rating service, which fits with what we saw in the alerts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.4 | Scroll down past the alerts to show **Log anomaly**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/rating-service.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps gives us additional context on the anomaly. In this case, the 'Unknown_error' anomaly is telling us that Watson AIOps has never seen this type of log before (hence the “unknown”) and that the log message indicates there is some type of error. Watson AIOps is not only looking at the statistical frequency of the type of log, but it is also using Natural Language Processing to analyze the content of the log message to give additional context (in this case that there’s likely an error).<br/><br/>Watson AIOps also explains why the anomaly was flagged. It expected to see zero (0) of this type of log, but it actually saw four (4).<br/><br/>Now we know that there is an unfamiliar log coming from the Rating service, and it’s indicating an error.<br/><br/>This further reinforces what we saw with the alerts -  it looks like the Rating service is likely the root cause of this problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **Show more**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/anomaly.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | Notice that there are four log messages matching the template. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/log-anomaly-1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can preview the log messages that caused Watson AIOps to find the anomaly. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | For the **Unknown_error** anomaly, click **Preview logs**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/preview-logs.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | The **Log preview** pop-up will appear. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/log-preview.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Close the **Log preview** pop-up. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/4.1.1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Examining the AIOps-derived resolution recommendations</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Review the curated set of similar incidents for recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now that we understand a bit more about what’s going on, we need to focus on our main goal: resolving the incident as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Watson AIOps also brings in similar incidents and information regarding how they were resolved. This enhances operational efficiency by leveraging institutional knowledge that may be time-consuming to find otherwise.<br/><br/>Since the alerts seem to point to the Rating service as having increases in CPU and memory, we’ll search for incidents that happened with that service. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click **Search similar incidents**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-similar-incidents.png\" width=\"800\" />\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Type **rating** into the search box. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png\" width=\"800\" />\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps found two similar incidents. The first one seems like what we’re experiencing: 'Rating service overheating and slowing.' Using Natural Language Processing, Watson AIOps  went through the comments on the incident and highlighted key relevant information for us (in this case that the incident was resolved by running a runbook). If we can use the same runbook to resolve the current incident, it will make our job that much easier and restore service even faster! |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Review the  **Search results** window. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-results.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The description for this incident sounds a lot like what we are observing right now. The Rating service is stressed, with increases in CPU, memory, and latency. It’s also affecting the Web service. The comment says there is a runbook that resolved this issue. This is very useful information that may have taken a long time to find out just by searching or asking colleagues. Watson AIOps helped us find this info very quickly. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.4 | Click the link for the first similar incident **Rating service overheating and slowing**. It will open a window in GitLab. If needed, sort comments **newest first**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/newest-first.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Determining the root cause of the incident</summary>\n\n| **5.1** | **Understand the topological scope of the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now that we have a high level understanding of the incident, let's take a quick look at the topology of the application to understand which components are impacted and their relationships with other services in the application. The component dependencies will help us better understand and assess the potential impact of cascading failures. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Click the **qotd-application** link. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/30.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Navigate to <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/31.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Click the **hierarchy** icon to change the default topology orientation from a directed graph to an **inverted tree**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/32.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.4 | Point out the topological entities (marked in red). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/33.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The qotd-web service is at the root of the tree and has a direct dependency on the qotd-rating service. Hence, any performance issues with the ratings service will impact the qotd-web service, which directly and negatively impacts the end user experience. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.2** | **Deep dive into the service code to establish the root cause** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | This is the event management component of Watson AIOps. Here’s the event group that we’re working on. There are four events grouped together – these are the same ones we previewed earlier from the Slack notification. There are additional details here, including the likelihood of each event being the root cause of the overall issue and if there is a runbook associated with the event.<br/><br/>There are three events that occurred on the Rating service. They’re all rated as 99% likely to be the root cause, meaning that the Rating service is the source of the problem.<br/><br/>It also shows us that there’s a runbook associated with these events, which is what was mentioned in the GitLab incident comment. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Navigate to the **Event Manager** tab (you should already have this open from the demo preparation). Click **Events** on the sidebar menu. The top event should show a red circle (**critical**). Click the **Down** arrow to expand it. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/37.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now we’ll execute the runbook that should resolve the underlying failure of the Rating service. That should fix the problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | Click the second row (**Summary** column: **Rating service Mem usage very high**). Click **Execute runbook**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/47.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.3 | Click **Start runbook**. <br/> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/48.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.4 | Click **Run**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/50.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | To check that the runbook is fixing the problem, we can look at the health metrics in Instana. We’ll set the time period so that we can see data from when the incident began until now. <br/><br/> We can see that the latency of the application started increasing when the problem began. Now that we’ve run the runbook, latency is going back down. This confirms that the runbook was successful. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.5 | Navigate to **Instana**. Click the **Summary** tab. Set the time period to **last 5 minutes**, and click the **Live** button (you will be showing the latency before, during, and after the incident). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/52.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The runbook worked <br/><br/> Verified via Instana <br/><br/> Close the runbook |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.5 | Navigate back to **Event Manager** to provide feedback on the runbook, and then click **Runbook Worked**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/51.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.3** | **Analyze the grouping of generated alerts in the event** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.3.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>6 - Fixing the problem and restoring the service</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **6.1** | **Take remedial action to fix the root cause of the failure** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>7 - Verifying that the fix actually resolved the incident</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **7.1** | **Review the golden signals of Quote of the Day** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 7.1.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **7.2** | **Review the topology to check if the impacted services are restored** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 7.2.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>8 - Closing the incident</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **8.1** | **Provide feedback on the runbook** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We can rate the runbook to preserve the information that it was successful.

The various anomalies represent real world performance issues that applications typically face like high CPU usage, memory leaks, or network congestion. <br/><br/> Now, let's examine the current state of the Quote of the Day application and understand the impact of the failures. Observe the increase in the number of calls, the error rate, increasing latency, and CPU processing time. <br/><br/> In the Top Services chart, notice the higher response times of the qotd-ratings service with respect to the other services. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Navigate back to the **Instana** Tab.

This includes recommendations for how to resolve the incident. We can take action directly from the notification and resolve the incident quickly. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.3** | **Review the golden signals of Quote of the Day** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Getting notified of an emerging problem via ChatOps</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **AIOps packages the notification along with relevant details as a story** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Notifications are now appearing in Slack. We’re using Slack in this demo, but Watson AIOps also integrates with Microsoft Teams. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps formats the notifications into a “story” using AI to correlate events, metrics, alerts, and logs. Each story brings together the various notifications for all the affected services by the same underlying issue. Imagine if each piece of data presented in the story was a separate notification – we’d quickly be inundated with alerts. <br/><br/> The story is like a home base for action when a problem arises. Instead of manually correlating things across multiple different tools, it’s all right here immediately when the notification is received. <br/><br/> In addition to providing a highly contextualized view of the incident, it enables us to jump to other tools to explore further details. This eliminates tool silos and helps us restore service faster.<br/><br/>This story is telling us there’s a problem with the Rating service, which is one of the microservices in our Quote of the Day application. <br/><br/> In the background, the AI has done the work for us. It shows which services are affected and presents us with a curated view of relevant information: the events and alerts that are indicative of the symptoms of this problem, anomalies that Watson AIOps has found in the log files, and similar incidents that have occurred in the past so we can see how they were successfully resolved. We’ll explore each of these components in more detail. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | The story starts showing up in Slack. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/13.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | When this story first appeared, the only affected service was the Rating service.<br/><br/>Watson AIOps updates the stories in real time as more information comes in and gets correlated to this story. <br/><br/>So now we can see that in addition to the Rating service, the Web service is also affected. This is now even more critical since the Web service is the customer-facing front end of the application, and we need to ensure that users can still access the app.<br/><br/>We need to find the root cause and fix this problem as quickly as possible. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Additional affected services are added to the story. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/14.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Take ownership of the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** |  |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 |  |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Understanding the AIOps generated story</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Analyze the notifications to learn about the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We need to find out where the issue began, so we can prevent it from causing cascading failures across the components of the application. <br/><br/> Instead of having to hop between tools to look for alerts, we can see them right here from the notification. Watson AIOps has determined that these events are related, and it provides an explanation for how it determined the relationships. We can see that there are two groups of events based on related resources and the timing of the events. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Scroll to the **View alert details** section of the story. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/15.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can inspect the grouped events right here, without searching for them in another tool.<br/><br/>It looks like the memory and CPU on the Rating service increased significantly. This is causing a significant slowdown in the response times on both the Rating and Web services.<br/><br/>Based on this information, it seems that the Rating service is the source of the issue. But let’s get a bit more detail – this time from the log files. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click the **View relevant events** button at the bottom of the notification. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/view-relevant-events.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | A pop-up will appear with the grouped events. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/relevant-events-alerts.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Instead of needing to go to Kibana and manually sort through the hundreds or thousands of log entries that come in every minute, Watson AIOps has found several anomalies in the log files and presented them here. It trains on the log files of the application when it’s operating normally, and it continually monitors for deviations from that baseline. We can see that the anomalies are occurring on the Rating service, which fits with what we saw in the alerts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.4 | Scroll down past the alerts to show **Log anomaly**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/rating-service.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps gives us additional context on the anomaly. In this case, the 'Unknown_error' anomaly is telling us that Watson AIOps has never seen this type of log before (hence the “unknown”) and that the log message indicates there is some type of error. Watson AIOps is not only looking at the statistical frequency of the type of log, but it is also using Natural Language Processing to analyze the content of the log message to give additional context (in this case that there’s likely an error).<br/><br/>Watson AIOps also explains why the anomaly was flagged. It expected to see zero (0) of this type of log, but it actually saw four (4).<br/><br/>Now we know that there is an unfamiliar log coming from the Rating service, and it’s indicating an error.<br/><br/>This further reinforces what we saw with the alerts -  it looks like the Rating service is likely the root cause of this problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **Show more**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/anomaly.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | Notice that there are four log messages matching the template. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/log-anomaly-1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can preview the log messages that caused Watson AIOps to find the anomaly. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | For the **Unknown_error** anomaly, click **Preview logs**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/preview-logs.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | The **Log preview** pop-up will appear. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/log-preview.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Close the **Log preview** pop-up. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/4.1.1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Examining the AIOps-derived resolution recommendations</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Review the curated set of similar incidents for recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now that we understand a bit more about what’s going on, we need to focus on our main goal: resolving the incident as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Watson AIOps also brings in similar incidents and information regarding how they were resolved. This enhances operational efficiency by leveraging institutional knowledge that may be time-consuming to find otherwise.<br/><br/>Since the alerts seem to point to the Rating service as having increases in CPU and memory, we’ll search for incidents that happened with that service. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click **Search similar incidents**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-similar-incidents.png\" width=\"800\" />\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Type **rating** into the search box. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png\" width=\"800\" />\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps found two similar incidents. The first one seems like what we’re experiencing: 'Rating service overheating and slowing.' Using Natural Language Processing, Watson AIOps  went through the comments on the incident and highlighted key relevant information for us (in this case that the incident was resolved by running a runbook). If we can use the same runbook to resolve the current incident, it will make our job that much easier and restore service even faster! |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Review the  **Search results** window. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/search-results.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The description for this incident sounds a lot like what we are observing right now. The Rating service is stressed, with increases in CPU, memory, and latency. It’s also affecting the Web service. The comment says there is a runbook that resolved this issue. This is very useful information that may have taken a long time to find out just by searching or asking colleagues. Watson AIOps helped us find this info very quickly. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.4 | Click the link for the first similar incident **Rating service overheating and slowing**. It will open a window in GitLab. If needed, sort comments **newest first**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/newest-first.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Determining the root cause of the incident</summary>\n\n| **5.1** | **Understand the topological scope of the incident** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now that we have a high level understanding of the incident, let's take a quick look at the topology of the application to understand which components are impacted and their relationships with other services in the application. The component dependencies will help us better understand and assess the potential impact of cascading failures. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Click the **qotd-application** link. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/30.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Navigate to <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/31.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Click the **hierarchy** icon to change the default topology orientation from a directed graph to an **inverted tree**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/32.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.4 | Point out the topological entities (marked in red). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/33.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The qotd-web service is at the root of the tree and has a direct dependency on the qotd-rating service. Hence, any performance issues with the ratings service will impact the qotd-web service, which directly and negatively impacts the end user experience. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.2** | **Deep dive into the service code to establish the root cause** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | This is the event management component of Watson AIOps. Here’s the event group that we’re working on. There are four events grouped together – these are the same ones we previewed earlier from the Slack notification. There are additional details here, including the likelihood of each event being the root cause of the overall issue and if there is a runbook associated with the event.<br/><br/>There are three events that occurred on the Rating service. They’re all rated as 99% likely to be the root cause, meaning that the Rating service is the source of the problem.<br/><br/>It also shows us that there’s a runbook associated with these events, which is what was mentioned in the GitLab incident comment. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Navigate to the **Event Manager** tab (you should already have this open from the demo preparation). Click **Events** on the sidebar menu. The top event should show a red circle (**critical**). Click the **Down** arrow to expand it. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/37.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now we’ll execute the runbook that should resolve the underlying failure of the Rating service. That should fix the problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | Click the second row (**Summary** column: **Rating service Mem usage very high**). Click **Execute runbook**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/47.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.3 | Click **Start runbook**. <br/> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/48.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.4 | Click **Run**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-incident-resolution/images/50.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | To check that the runbook is fixing the problem, we can look at the health metrics in Instana. We’ll set the time period so that we can see data from when the incident began until now. <br/><br/> We can see that the latency of the application started increasing when the problem began. Now that we’ve run the runbook, latency is going back down. This confirms that the runbook was successful. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.5 | Navigate to **Instana**. Click the **Summary** tab.
