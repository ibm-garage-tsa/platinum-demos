The bank has just wrapped up its cloud migration initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted-and-shifted to either AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. However, this transition has resulted in higher than expected cloud costs, and the bank's monthly cloud bills have been getting regular executive attention from the financial team. The CIO has formed a new FinOps group to address the issue.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how the IBM Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe demo is divided into four sections:\n\n<br/>\n\n1) Getting a global view of multi-cloud costs and saving opportunities <br/>\n2) Rightsizing compute instances <br/>\n3) Optimizing storage volumes <br/>\n4) Leveraging cloud provider discounts <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s start with some basics. In the public cloud (pay-as-you-go) model, the total spend is calculated by multiplying the resources you're consuming by the rate you're paying. Therefore, cloud cost savings can be realized by either reducing consumption or lowering your rate.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s look at how Turbonomic can help with both.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Getting a global view of multi-cloud costs and saving opportunities</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Get visibility into the cloud deployment** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can do any cost optimization, they must get a global view into their workloads. Turbonomic automatically creates a service graph that models the dynamic relationships of the workloads and their dependent infrastructure layers. This provides a full stack view from the application down to all the dependent cloud resources. <br/><br/> Let's look at the Cloud view, which combines all our accounts on public cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | After logging in to the **Turbonomic** instance, select the **CLOUD** view and point out the categories of entites. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-1-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | There are three categories of entities: <br/><br/> • Entities that represent the *application workload* (1) <br/> • Entities that represent the *container platform* (2) <br/> • Entities related to the *cloud services*, such as compute instances, storage volumes, and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services (3) <br/><br/> Since the bank is dealing with the cloud, let’s start by examining the 'Region' entity. A Region is a logical grouping of physical data centers (Zones) that are in close geographic proximity. A 'Region' is comprised of one or more of these Zones. A 'Zone' represents an Availability Zone in your public cloud account or subscription. In the language of public clouds, a Zone is a data center. <br/><br/> The current service view shows there are 90 Regions and 173 Availability Zones. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Select the **Region** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-2-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s get a high-level understanding of the geographical spread of the bank's workloads across these 90 Regions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Click **LIST OF REGIONS**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-5-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This chart lists out the 90 Regions from both AWS and Azure, along with the workloads running in a given region. Let’s take a look at the AWS workloads. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Click the **FILTER** icon. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-4.png\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Set the filter to: **Cloud Provider** (1), **equals** (2), and **AWS** (3). Click **APPLY** (4). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-7-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Point out the spread of the workloads across the various cloud regions. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-8-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We see that most workloads are concentrated primarily in three regions: US East Ohio (1), US East Northern Virginia (2), and US West Oregon (3). There are also several regions that contain minimal to zero workloads running. This information is important because it can help the bank make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchasing pre-paid volume discounts, such as regional or zonal reserved instances (RIs), for maximum financial benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.7 | Click **X** to exit the **Cloud:  Regions** view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-6.png\" width=\"50\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global Cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Identify the top accounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can make any cloud cost optimization decisions, they must understand several aspects of the cloud deployment. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is unscalable and highly inefficient. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | In the **EA - Development** row of the **Top Accounts** chart, point out the values under the **30-Day Cost** (1) and **Potential Savings** (2) columns. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since this is a live application, you may not see the same view. In any case, select the row that has both the <strong>30-Day Cost</strong> and <strong>Potential Savings</strong> columns populated. </InlineNotification> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-2-1-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The 'Top Accounts' chart lists the bank's most utilized public cloud accounts and their estimated monthly costs. Taking the recommended actions can result in a large potential savings (10% in the case of this demo, but it could easily be substantially more). Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** chart, point out the **total potential monthly savings** (1) inside the donut chart and the **breakdown** list (2). <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-2-2-B.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the donut chart provides the bank an estimate of the total potential monthly savings. In the breakdown on the right, we see that the bulk of these savings can be realized by: A) rightsizing compute instances, B) buying reserved instances, C) rightsizing storage capacity, and D) eliminating waste. <br/><br/> Let’s take a closer look at each of these saving opportunities. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – they can total as much as 50%. Hence, it makes sense that the bank starts their FinOps initiative by optimizing their compute resources. In the language of Turbonomic, optimizing compute resources and scaling virtual machines mean the same thing. Lift-and-shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables the ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by scaling virtual machines. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-1-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Select **Virtual Machines** under the **SCALE** category, and point out the details on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed for the bank to realize their potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three categories: <br/><br/> • Scale (1): Identifies cost reductions that can be achieved by addressing overprovisioning of compute instances, storage volumes, and PaaS resources (i.e., database servers) <br/> • Delete (2): Provides recommendations to get rid of unattached storage (i.e., storage that is not being used) <br/> • Buy (3): Recommends the purchase of highly-discounted reserved instances to further reduce total costs <br/><br/> In this view, the 'Total Savings' represents the cost reduction the bank can gain by accepting and executing all the recommended 'Scale Virtual Machines' actions. <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since this is a live application, the first row in your view may not look exactly the same. </InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Point out the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance [*m5.4xlarge EC2*] is highly underutilized based on the observation period (1). Turbonomic makes a recommendation to scale down to a different instance [*r5a.2xlarge*] (2). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (3), and there will be no change in the memory utilization (4). Making the recommended change will decrease the on-demand price (5) and on-demand monthly cost (6). This would result in an approximate savings of $230.57 for this one instance (7). <br/><br/> Based on this optimization, the bank can save approximately 42% on the cost of the resource. Note that the potential savings are on the on-demand price. Later in the demo, we will explore how this price can be further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The 'Execute Action' button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump between disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-5-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Turbonomic continuously performs these cost optimization calculations in real time across large-scale deployments at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are time-consuming, unable to keep up, and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast of these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing the bank with updated recommendations based on the lastest cloud offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | There are three forms of cloud storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. The bank's cost optimization effort focuses on block storage, which functions like an external disk to the compute instance and provides low-latency state management for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> At a general level, there are two categories of block storage: solid state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads, whereas HDDs are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> It is important for the bank to choose a storage service based on the workload characteristics at hand. It is often the case that: <br/><br/> 1) Compute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2) Storage services are grossly overprovisioned. (For most cloud resources, you pay for what you *provision*, not for what you *use*.) <br/> 3) The storage choices are not compatible with the requirements of the specific workload. (For example, transaction processing is often best done on fast SSDs, whereas sequential workloads -- like logging -- are more compatible with cost-effective HDDs.) This can result in either suboptimal performance or cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Point out the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By looking at the 'Volume' entity in the global supply chain, we can see that there are about 1000 storage volumes in this environment. Notice the color coding in the donuts: \"green\" means healthy, “yellow” represents efficiency recommendations, and “red” represents performance recommendation. Based on the proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow, the bank can see that about half of the environment is operating correctly, but there are also significant opportunities to improve the performance and cost efficiency of storage. <br/><br/> Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click the **Volume** entity, which will take you to the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Point out the details on the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-2-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (1), total monthly cost of these volumes (2), and potential monthly savings that can be realized (3). The Unattached Storage bar (4) shows that close to 30% of storage is currently unused. <br/><br/> Let’s take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Under the **DELETE** section of the left navigation bar, click **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart identifies the bank's storage volumes that are unattached, including the number of days they have gone unused. On cloud, the lifecycles of the storage volumes are not intentionally associated with the lifecycles of the compute instances. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. Here, the savings that can be obtained from Azure are double that of AWS. The chart also computes the bank's total savings, assuming they take all the recommended actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days (1), and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-3-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Point out the details under **ACTION ESSENTIALS** on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-4-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides the bank with supporting details behind the recommendation. Under the 'Action Essentials' section (1), it also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action is manually reversible once taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-5-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s examine the bank's cost savings opportunities from moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for the workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The bank needs to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost reduction opportunities using its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** category of the left navigation bar, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-1-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the bank's projected savings if either: 1) all recommended actions are taken, or 2) a subset of actions is taken selectively. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Point out the details on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-3-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can see that this particular volume is underutilized from both IOPS and throughput perspectives (1). Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, Turbonomic's analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk (2). This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS (3). We therefore see that the storage capacity was overprovisioned by a factor of ten, at a cost that was 10x too high. The analytics compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel (4). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-4-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Potential Savings** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-5-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By analyzing and understanding the data access patterns of their workloads, the bank can make cost-efficient trade-offs about their storage choices, including the storage type, capacity, and IOPS. In addition, Turbonomic can automate the execution of its recommendations, so the bank doesn't pay for extra days of unused resources. Turbonomic makes it easy for the bank to codify their automation policies aligned with their governance and risk management practices. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Understand current pre-paid commitments** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We've seen two primary ways in which the bank can reduce consumption: proactively eliminating waste and rightsizing capacity. In a pay-as-you-go cloud model, this directly impacts the usage levels and therefore has a direct consequence on the bank's cloud bill. The other variable of this cloud spend equation is the unit price the bank pays for these resources. <br/><br/> All cloud providers offer discounts (typically up to 70% of the on-demand prices) in exchange for commitments of usage. These discounts can greatly reduce the rates, and it is financially beneficial for the bank to run as many workloads as possible under these discounts. Since these are commitments, any unused capacity will be lost. <br/><br/> Keeping track of reservations, monitoring utilization levels, and planning for additional purchases require strong and continuous governance. Doing all this across a growing multi-cloud environment cannot be easily done manually. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the Turbonomic platform can help the bank serve as a decision-support tool when dealing with pre-paid capacity. As always, the first step to rate optimization is to get visibility into existing pre-paid reservations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | In the **Discount Inventory** panel of the global cloud view, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Point out the details on the **Discount Inventory** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Discount Inventory panel shows the bank's discounted pricing commitments with their cloud providers. Each cloud provider is on a separate tab (1). Let's explore the AWS Reserved Instances tab. <br/><br/> Above the table, we see the total number of reserved instances, monthly cost, and monthly savings (2). In the table, each row represents an individual reservation, and the columns show the basic information about the reserved instance. All this information is automatically discovered from the bank's cloud provider. <br/><br/> At a high level, we can see which accounts own the reservation (3), the instance type covered by this reservation (4), and other details, such as whether it is a standard or convertible reserved instance (5). The 'Est. Savings' (6) and 'Effective Cost' (7) columns are very helpful to quantify the bank's ROI from purchasing these reserved instances. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click **X** to close the **Discount Inventory** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-3-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine utilization levels of existing discounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When used properly, reserved instances can deliver up to 70% of on-demand prices. Reserved instances that aren't consumed during the commitment period are forfeited. Hence, an awareness of what reservations the bank owns and how well they are utilized is necessary to maximize their ROI. Let’s take a look at RI utilization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | In the **Discount Utilization** chart, hover over the **AWS RI** data point on the black vertical line. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-2-1-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The graph shows the bank's reservation utilization data pulled from their cloud providers. Data points to the left of the black vertical line represent historical data, while data points to the right are projections into the future. AWS uses Normalized Factor Units (NFUs), and Azure uses ratios as a uniform unit of measure of compute capacity to help combine and compare capacity across different instance types. <br/><br/> The graph shows current utilization of AWS at around 8% and of Azure at around 73%. As part of the optimization process, it is projected that reservation utilization levels will increase to 60% and 90% for AWS and Azure respectively. <br/><br/> The bank's underlying goal here is to maximize the utilization of their inventory and cover as many workloads as possible. In this way, they can take advantage of these highly discounted prices and reduce their total cost of ownership. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.3** | **Explore the additional RI purchase recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | In the **Recommended RI Purchases** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row for additional information. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Reservations require a commitment and cost money. An all-upfront reservation provides the largest return, but it requires the full payment at the time of purchase. This is a bit contrary to the pay-as-you-go cloud model.

While cost optimization is important, it should not be done at the expense of application performance. Gen-Z can leverage the Turbonomic platform to get a deeper visibility into their cloud deployment. They can use platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, right-fit storage layer architectural choices, and automate the execution of these analytics where appropriate. This ensures their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized, so the bank can achieve the lowest cost without sacrificing their performance needs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"781b3a8b7b9f52f77c4863b8e10b8bc8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":2707},"frontmatter":{"title":"Managing cost on public cloud 300-level live demo","description":"Managing cost on public cloud 300-level live demo","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Managing cost on public cloud\n  300-level live demo\ndescription: Managing cost on public cloud 300-level live demo\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Managing cost on public cloud <br/> 300-level live demo\n  </span> );\n\n\n\n<span id=\"top\"></span>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Introduction</summary>\n<br/>\n\nGen-Z bank is a financial services platform catering primarily to millennials. The bank has just wrapped up its cloud migration initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted-and-shifted to either AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. However, this transition has resulted in higher than expected cloud costs, and the bank's monthly cloud bills have been getting regular executive attention from the financial team. The CIO has formed a new FinOps group to address the issue.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how the IBM Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe demo is divided into four sections:\n\n<br/>\n\n1) Getting a global view of multi-cloud costs and saving opportunities <br/>\n2) Rightsizing compute instances <br/>\n3) Optimizing storage volumes <br/>\n4) Leveraging cloud provider discounts <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s start with some basics. In the public cloud (pay-as-you-go) model, the total spend is calculated by multiplying the resources you're consuming by the rate you're paying. Therefore, cloud cost savings can be realized by either reducing consumption or lowering your rate.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s look at how Turbonomic can help with both.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Getting a global view of multi-cloud costs and saving opportunities</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Get visibility into the cloud deployment** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can do any cost optimization, they must get a global view into their workloads. Turbonomic automatically creates a service graph that models the dynamic relationships of the workloads and their dependent infrastructure layers. This provides a full stack view from the application down to all the dependent cloud resources. <br/><br/> Let's look at the Cloud view, which combines all our accounts on public cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | After logging in to the **Turbonomic** instance, select the **CLOUD** view and point out the categories of entites. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-1-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | There are three categories of entities: <br/><br/> • Entities that represent the *application workload* (1) <br/> • Entities that represent the *container platform* (2) <br/> • Entities related to the *cloud services*, such as compute instances, storage volumes, and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services (3) <br/><br/> Since the bank is dealing with the cloud, let’s start by examining the 'Region' entity. A Region is a logical grouping of physical data centers (Zones) that are in close geographic proximity. A 'Region' is comprised of one or more of these Zones. A 'Zone' represents an Availability Zone in your public cloud account or subscription. In the language of public clouds, a Zone is a data center. <br/><br/> The current service view shows there are 90 Regions and 173 Availability Zones. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Select the **Region** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-2-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s get a high-level understanding of the geographical spread of the bank's workloads across these 90 Regions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Click **LIST OF REGIONS**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-5-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This chart lists out the 90 Regions from both AWS and Azure, along with the workloads running in a given region. Let’s take a look at the AWS workloads. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Click the **FILTER** icon. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-4.png\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Set the filter to: **Cloud Provider** (1), **equals** (2), and **AWS** (3). Click **APPLY** (4). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-7-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Point out the spread of the workloads across the various cloud regions. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-8-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We see that most workloads are concentrated primarily in three regions: US East Ohio (1), US East Northern Virginia (2), and US West Oregon (3). There are also several regions that contain minimal to zero workloads running. This information is important because it can help the bank make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchasing pre-paid volume discounts, such as regional or zonal reserved instances (RIs), for maximum financial benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.7 | Click **X** to exit the **Cloud:  Regions** view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-1-6.png\" width=\"50\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global Cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Identify the top accounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can make any cloud cost optimization decisions, they must understand several aspects of the cloud deployment. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is unscalable and highly inefficient. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | In the **EA - Development** row of the **Top Accounts** chart, point out the values under the **30-Day Cost** (1) and **Potential Savings** (2) columns. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since this is a live application, you may not see the same view. In any case, select the row that has both the <strong>30-Day Cost</strong> and <strong>Potential Savings</strong> columns populated. </InlineNotification> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-2-1-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The 'Top Accounts' chart lists the bank's most utilized public cloud accounts and their estimated monthly costs. Taking the recommended actions can result in a large potential savings (10% in the case of this demo, but it could easily be substantially more). Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** chart, point out the **total potential monthly savings** (1) inside the donut chart and the **breakdown** list (2). <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/1-2-2-B.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the donut chart provides the bank an estimate of the total potential monthly savings. In the breakdown on the right, we see that the bulk of these savings can be realized by: A) rightsizing compute instances, B) buying reserved instances, C) rightsizing storage capacity, and D) eliminating waste. <br/><br/> Let’s take a closer look at each of these saving opportunities. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – they can total as much as 50%. Hence, it makes sense that the bank starts their FinOps initiative by optimizing their compute resources. In the language of Turbonomic, optimizing compute resources and scaling virtual machines mean the same thing. Lift-and-shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables the ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by scaling virtual machines. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-1-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Select **Virtual Machines** under the **SCALE** category, and point out the details on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed for the bank to realize their potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three categories: <br/><br/> • Scale (1): Identifies cost reductions that can be achieved by addressing overprovisioning of compute instances, storage volumes, and PaaS resources (i.e., database servers) <br/> • Delete (2): Provides recommendations to get rid of unattached storage (i.e., storage that is not being used) <br/> • Buy (3): Recommends the purchase of highly-discounted reserved instances to further reduce total costs <br/><br/> In this view, the 'Total Savings' represents the cost reduction the bank can gain by accepting and executing all the recommended 'Scale Virtual Machines' actions. <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since this is a live application, the first row in your view may not look exactly the same. </InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Point out the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance [*m5.4xlarge EC2*] is highly underutilized based on the observation period (1). Turbonomic makes a recommendation to scale down to a different instance [*r5a.2xlarge*] (2). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (3), and there will be no change in the memory utilization (4). Making the recommended change will decrease the on-demand price (5) and on-demand monthly cost (6). This would result in an approximate savings of $230.57 for this one instance (7). <br/><br/> Based on this optimization, the bank can save approximately 42% on the cost of the resource. Note that the potential savings are on the on-demand price. Later in the demo, we will explore how this price can be further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The 'Execute Action' button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump between disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/2-1-5-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Turbonomic continuously performs these cost optimization calculations in real time across large-scale deployments at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are time-consuming, unable to keep up, and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast of these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing the bank with updated recommendations based on the lastest cloud offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | There are three forms of cloud storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. The bank's cost optimization effort focuses on block storage, which functions like an external disk to the compute instance and provides low-latency state management for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> At a general level, there are two categories of block storage: solid state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads, whereas HDDs are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> It is important for the bank to choose a storage service based on the workload characteristics at hand. It is often the case that: <br/><br/> 1) Compute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2) Storage services are grossly overprovisioned. (For most cloud resources, you pay for what you *provision*, not for what you *use*.) <br/> 3) The storage choices are not compatible with the requirements of the specific workload. (For example, transaction processing is often best done on fast SSDs, whereas sequential workloads -- like logging -- are more compatible with cost-effective HDDs.) This can result in either suboptimal performance or cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Point out the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By looking at the 'Volume' entity in the global supply chain, we can see that there are about 1000 storage volumes in this environment. Notice the color coding in the donuts: \"green\" means healthy, “yellow” represents efficiency recommendations, and “red” represents performance recommendation. Based on the proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow, the bank can see that about half of the environment is operating correctly, but there are also significant opportunities to improve the performance and cost efficiency of storage. <br/><br/> Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click the **Volume** entity, which will take you to the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Point out the details on the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-1-2-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (1), total monthly cost of these volumes (2), and potential monthly savings that can be realized (3). The Unattached Storage bar (4) shows that close to 30% of storage is currently unused. <br/><br/> Let’s take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Under the **DELETE** section of the left navigation bar, click **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart identifies the bank's storage volumes that are unattached, including the number of days they have gone unused. On cloud, the lifecycles of the storage volumes are not intentionally associated with the lifecycles of the compute instances. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. Here, the savings that can be obtained from Azure are double that of AWS. The chart also computes the bank's total savings, assuming they take all the recommended actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days (1), and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-3-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Point out the details under **ACTION ESSENTIALS** on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-4-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides the bank with supporting details behind the recommendation. Under the 'Action Essentials' section (1), it also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action is manually reversible once taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-2-5-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s examine the bank's cost savings opportunities from moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for the workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The bank needs to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost reduction opportunities using its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** category of the left navigation bar, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-1-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the bank's projected savings if either: 1) all recommended actions are taken, or 2) a subset of actions is taken selectively. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Point out the details on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-3-B.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can see that this particular volume is underutilized from both IOPS and throughput perspectives (1). Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, Turbonomic's analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk (2). This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS (3). We therefore see that the storage capacity was overprovisioned by a factor of ten, at a cost that was 10x too high. The analytics compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel (4). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-4-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Potential Savings** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/3-3-5-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By analyzing and understanding the data access patterns of their workloads, the bank can make cost-efficient trade-offs about their storage choices, including the storage type, capacity, and IOPS. In addition, Turbonomic can automate the execution of its recommendations, so the bank doesn't pay for extra days of unused resources. Turbonomic makes it easy for the bank to codify their automation policies aligned with their governance and risk management practices. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Understand current pre-paid commitments** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We've seen two primary ways in which the bank can reduce consumption: proactively eliminating waste and rightsizing capacity. In a pay-as-you-go cloud model, this directly impacts the usage levels and therefore has a direct consequence on the bank's cloud bill. The other variable of this cloud spend equation is the unit price the bank pays for these resources. <br/><br/> All cloud providers offer discounts (typically up to 70% of the on-demand prices) in exchange for commitments of usage. These discounts can greatly reduce the rates, and it is financially beneficial for the bank to run as many workloads as possible under these discounts. Since these are commitments, any unused capacity will be lost. <br/><br/> Keeping track of reservations, monitoring utilization levels, and planning for additional purchases require strong and continuous governance. Doing all this across a growing multi-cloud environment cannot be easily done manually. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the Turbonomic platform can help the bank serve as a decision-support tool when dealing with pre-paid capacity. As always, the first step to rate optimization is to get visibility into existing pre-paid reservations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | In the **Discount Inventory** panel of the global cloud view, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Point out the details on the **Discount Inventory** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Discount Inventory panel shows the bank's discounted pricing commitments with their cloud providers. Each cloud provider is on a separate tab (1). Let's explore the AWS Reserved Instances tab. <br/><br/> Above the table, we see the total number of reserved instances, monthly cost, and monthly savings (2). In the table, each row represents an individual reservation, and the columns show the basic information about the reserved instance. All this information is automatically discovered from the bank's cloud provider. <br/><br/> At a high level, we can see which accounts own the reservation (3), the instance type covered by this reservation (4), and other details, such as whether it is a standard or convertible reserved instance (5). The 'Est. Savings' (6) and 'Effective Cost' (7) columns are very helpful to quantify the bank's ROI from purchasing these reserved instances. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click **X** to close the **Discount Inventory** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-1-3-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine utilization levels of existing discounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When used properly, reserved instances can deliver up to 70% of on-demand prices. Reserved instances that aren't consumed during the commitment period are forfeited. Hence, an awareness of what reservations the bank owns and how well they are utilized is necessary to maximize their ROI. Let’s take a look at RI utilization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | In the **Discount Utilization** chart, hover over the **AWS RI** data point on the black vertical line. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-2-1-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The graph shows the bank's reservation utilization data pulled from their cloud providers. Data points to the left of the black vertical line represent historical data, while data points to the right are projections into the future. AWS uses Normalized Factor Units (NFUs), and Azure uses ratios as a uniform unit of measure of compute capacity to help combine and compare capacity across different instance types. <br/><br/> The graph shows current utilization of AWS at around 8% and of Azure at around 73%. As part of the optimization process, it is projected that reservation utilization levels will increase to 60% and 90% for AWS and Azure respectively. <br/><br/> The bank's underlying goal here is to maximize the utilization of their inventory and cover as many workloads as possible. In this way, they can take advantage of these highly discounted prices and reduce their total cost of ownership. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.3** | **Explore the additional RI purchase recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | In the **Recommended RI Purchases** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-1-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row for additional information. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-2-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Reservations require a commitment and cost money. An all-upfront reservation provides the largest return, but it requires the full payment at the time of purchase. This is a bit contrary to the pay-as-you-go cloud model. However, over the committed term of one or three years, Turbonomic computes the break-even point, which is the time when the amortized cost of reserved instances will be better than paying the on-demand prices. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Point out the details on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-3-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Based on its analysis of the existing workloads, Turbonomic makes a recommendation to purchase additional reserved instances to increase coverage of workloads that can run at highly discounted prices (1). <br/><br/> When configuring Turbonomic, the bank set up a purchase profile indicating their preferences. Those preferences are then taken into account when making the recommendations on RI terms (2), such as one or three years, or RI class (3), such as standard or convertible. <br/><br/> The bank's estimated savings from purchasing these discounts can be as much as 42% (4). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-4-A.png\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Reserved Instances** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/images/4-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we've seen how the Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs. While cost optimization is important, it should not be done at the expense of application performance. Gen-Z can leverage the Turbonomic platform to get a deeper visibility into their cloud deployment. They can use platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, right-fit storage layer architectural choices, and automate the execution of these analytics where appropriate. This ensures their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized, so the bank can achieve the lowest cost without sacrificing their performance needs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-managing-cost-on-public-cloud/demo-script-sandbox.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
