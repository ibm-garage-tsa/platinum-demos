The bank has just wrapped up its multi-year cloud transformation initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted and shifted to either AWS or Azure. However, this transition has resulted in higher cloud costs than expected, and their monthly cloud bills have been getting regular executive attention. The CIO has formed a new FinOps team to address the issue.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how the IBM Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe demo is divided into four sections:\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Getting visibility into multi-cloud deployments and costs <br/>\n2. Rightsizing compute instances <br/>\n3. Optimizing storage volumes <br/>\n4. Leveraging cloud provider discounts <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s start with some basics. In the public cloud (pay-as-you-go) model, the total spend is calculated by multiplying the resources you're consuming by the rate you're paying. Therefore, cloud cost savings can be realized by either reducing consumption or lowering your rate.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s look at how Turbonomic can help with both.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Visualizing a multi-cloud deployment</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Get visibility into the cloud deployment** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can do any cost optimization, they must get a global view into the workloads. Turbonomic automatically creates a service graph that models the dynamic relationships of the workloads and their dependent infrastructure layers. This provides a full stack view from the application down to all the dependent cloud resources. <br/><br/> The application view presents the environment in the context of the business applications. Let's look at the cloud view. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Log in to the **Turbonomic** instance. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Select the **CLOUD** view. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Highlight the categories of entites. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-3-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | There are three categories of entities: <br/><br/> • Entities that represent the *application workload* (1) <br/> • Entities that represent the *supporting infrastructure*, such as containers and virtual machines (2) <br/> • Entities related to the *public cloud*, such as regions and availability zones (3) <br/><br/> Since the bank is dealing with the cloud, let’s start by examining the 'Region' entity. A Region is a logical grouping of physical availability zones that are in close geographical proximity. A 'Region' is comprised of one or more zones. A 'Zone' represents an Availability Zone in your public cloud account or subscription. A Zone is a location within a given region that serves as a data center. <br/><br/> The current service view shows there are 90 Regions and 173 Availability Zones. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Select the **Region** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-2-a.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s get a high-level understanding of the geographical spread of the bank's workloads across these 90 Regions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Click **LIST OF REGIONS**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-5-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This chart lists out the 90 Regions from both AWS and Azure, along with the workloads running in a given region. Let’s take a look at the AWS workloads. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Click the **FILTER** icon. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-4.png\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.7 | Set the filter to: **Cloud Provider** (1), **equals** (2), and **AWS** (3). Click **APPLY** (4). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-7-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We see that most workloads are concentrated primarily in three regions: US East Ohio, US East Northern Virginia, and US West Oregon. There are also several regions that contain minimal to zero workloads running. This information is important because it can help the bank make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchasing pre-paid programmatic discounts, such as regional or zonal reserved instances, for maximum benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.8 | Click **X** to exit the cloud region view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-6.png\" width=\"50\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Identify the top accounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can make any cloud cost optimization decisions, they must understand several aspects of the cloud estate. Their cloud environment is highly dynamic. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is highly inefficient, nonoptimal, and unscalable. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | In the **Top Accounts** chart, highlight the values under the **30-Day Cost** (1) and **Potential Savings** (2) columns of the **EA - Development** row. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Top Accounts chart lists the most utilized public cloud accounts and their estimated monthly costs. The example above shows that taking the recommended actions can result in a potential savings of close to 10%. Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge absolute savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** chart, highlight the **total potential monthly savings** inside the donut chart (1) and the **breakdown** list (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-2-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the donut chart provides an estimate of the total potential monthly savings that can be realized by collectively addressing overprovisioning, eliminating waste, and purchasing reservations. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> The list on the right provides a more granular breakdown. Let’s take a closer look. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing (downsizing) recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – it could be as much as 50%. Hence, it is logical that a cloud cost optimization effort starts with optimizing the choices around compute resources. Lift and shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables an ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency with minimal residual waste. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by optimizing compute resources. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-1-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Highlight the details behind the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed for the bank to realize their potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three actions: <br/><br/> • Scale (1): Mentions the efficiency actions of scaling down costs that can be done to address overprovisioning on compute instances, storage volumes, and PaaS resources like database servers <br/> • Delete (2): Provides recommendations to get rid of unattached storage <br/> • Buy (3): Recommends additional purchases of reserved instances to further reduce the operational cost of the cloud workloads <br/><br/> The 'Total Savings' (4) represent the cost reduction that the bank can gain by accepting and executing all the 'Scale' actions recommended on the identified compute instances. <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance [*m5.4xlarge EC2*] is highly underutilized, as derived by the platform based on the observation period (1). A recommendation is being made to scale down to a different instance [*r5a.2xlarge*] (2). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (3), and there will be no change in the memory utilization (4). Making the recommended change will decrease the on-demand rate (5) and on-demand monthly cost (6). This would result in an approximate savings of $230.57 for this one instance (7). <br/><br/> Based on this, the bank can easily extrapolate a total savings based on the scale of their deployment. It is also important to note that the potential savings are on the on-demand rate. Later in the demo, we will explore how this rate can be potentially further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The 'Execute Action' button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump across disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to exit the Action Details page. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-5-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | These optimization calculations need to be performed in real time across large-scale deployments at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are unable to keep up and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast with these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing the bank with updated recommendations based on the lastest technological offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | All workloads typically have a need to persist data. There are three forms of cloud storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. <br/><br/> This demo is focused on block storage. Block storage functions like an external disk to the compute instance. It provides low-latency durability for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> All cloud workloads are not the same. Transaction processing workloads have a different storage requirement than log processing or streaming video workloads. At a very general level, there are two categories of block storage: solid state backed devices and magnetic backed devices. <br/><br/> Solid state drives (SDDs) are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads. On the other hand, hard disk drives (HDDs) are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> When choosing a storage service as a part of the bank's deployment, it is important that these selections be made based on the workload characteristics at hand. It has been observed very often that: <br/><br/> 1.\tCompute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2.\tStorage services are grossly overprovisioned. <br/> 3. The storage choices are not compatible with workload characteristics, and this results in suboptimal performance and cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. <br/><br/> By looking at the Volume entity in the global supply chain, we can see that there are about 1000 odd storage volumes in this environment. The proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow is an indicator that about half of the environment is operating correctly. At a global level, the bank can tell there are significant opportunities to improve the cost efficiency of storage, and there are areas of performance improvement as well. Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Highlight the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-2-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (1), total monthly cost of these volumes (2), and potential monthly savings that can be realized (3). The Unattached Storage bar (4) shows that close to 30% of storage is unused. <br/><br/> Let’s take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-1-A.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** panel, click **Volumes** under the **DELETE** action category. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTIONS</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart mentions the specific volumes that are unattached, including the number of days it has been unattached. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. Here, the savings that can be obtained from Azure is double that of AWS. The chart also computes the bank's total savings, assuming they take all the recommended actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days (1), and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button (2). <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTIONS</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-4.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides supporting details behind the recommendation. It also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action is manually reversible once taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-5-A.png\" width=\"200\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s examine the bank's cost savings opportunities from moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for the workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The bank needs to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost-reduction opportunities using its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** action category, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-1-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the bank's projected savings if either, all, or each recommended action is taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This particular volume is underutilized from an IOPS and throughput perspective. Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, the analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk. This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS and an overprovisioning of as much as 10X. The analytics also compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Potential Savings** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Not all workloads are the same. Transaction workloads that do a lot of I/O and require low latency are best suited for SSD-based storage. On the other hand, sequentially oriented workloads, such as log processing or streaming workloads, are better suited for HDD-based storage. <br/><br/> By analyzing and understanding their workload data access patterns, the bank can make cost-efficient trade-offs on storage choices, such as storage type, capacity, and IOPS. Automatically executing the platform-derived cost optimization actions using an automation policy enables the bank to realize the savings at the earliest. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Understand current pre-paid commitments** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We've seen two primary ways in which the bank can reduce consumption: proactively eliminating waste and rightsizing capacity. In a pay-as-you-go cloud model, this directly impacts the usage levels and therefore has a direct consequence on the cloud bill. However, recall that the other side to this cloud spend equation is the rate for these resources. <br/><br/> All cloud providers offer discounts (up to 70% of the on-demand prices) in exchange for commitments of usage. These discounts can greatly reduce the rates, and it is financially beneficial for the bank to run as many workloads under these discounts. Since these are commitments, any unused capacity will be lost. <br/><br/> Keeping track of reservations, monitoring utilization levels, and planning for additional purchases require strong and continuous governance. Doing all this across a growing multi-cloud environment cannot be easily done manually. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the Turbonomic platform can serve as a decision-support tool when dealing with pre-paid capacity. As always, the first step to rate optimization is to get visibility into existing pre-paid reservations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | On the global cloud view, click **SHOW ALL** in the **Discount Inventory** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-1-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Highlight the **Discount Inventory** details. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-2.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Discount Inventory table shows the bank's discounted pricing commitments with their cloud providers. Each cloud provider is on a separate tab. Let's explore the AWS Reserved Instances tab. <br/><br/> Above the table, we can see the total number of reserved instances (RIs), monthly cost, and monthly savings. In the table, each row represents an individual reservation, and the columns show the basic information about the RI - all discovered from the bank's cloud provider. <br/><br/> At a high level, we can see which accounts own the reservation, the instance type covered by this reservation, and other details, such as whether it is a standard or convertible RI. The 'Est. Savings' and 'Effective Cost' columns are very helpful to quantify the bank's ROI from purchasing these RIs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click **X** to close the **Discount Inventory** details table. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine utilization levels of existing discounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When used properly, RIs can deliver up to 70% off on-demand prices. RIs that aren't consumed during the commitment period are forfeited. Hence, an awareness of what reservations the bank owns and how well they are utilized is necessary to maximize their ROI. Let’s take a look at RI utilization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | In the **Discount Utilization** chart, hover over the **AWS RI** data point on the black vertical line. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The graph shows the bank's reservation utilization data pulled from their cloud providers. Data points to the left of the vertical line represent historical data, while data points to the right are projections into the future. AWS uses Normalized Factor Units (NFU), and Azure uses ratios as a uniform unit of measure of compute capacity to help combine and compare capacity across different instance types. <br/><br/> The graph shows current utilization at around 8% and Azure at around 73%. As part of the optimization process, it is projected that reservation utilization levels will increase to 60% and 90% for AWS and Azure respectively. <br/><br/> Recall the bank's underlying goal here is to maximize the utilization of their inventory and cover as many workloads as possible. In this way, they can take advantage of these highly discounted prices and reduce their total cost of ownership. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.3** | **Explore the additional RI purchase recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | In the **Recommended RI Purchases** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-1-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row for additional information. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Reservations require a commitment and cost money. An all-upfront reservation provides the largest return, but it requires the full payment at the time of purchase. This is a bit contrary to the pay-as-you-go cloud model. However, over the committed term of one or three years, Turbonomic computes the break-even point, which is the time when the amortized cost of RIs will be better than paying the on-demand prices. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-3.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Based on its analysis of the existing workloads, Turbonomic makes recommendations to purchase additional RIs to increase coverage of workloads that can run at highly discounted prices. <br/><br/> When configuring Turbonomic, the bank needs to set up a purchase profile indicating their preferences.

The bank has just wrapped up its multi-year cloud transformation initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted and shifted to either AWS or Azure. However, this transition has resulted in higher cloud costs than expected, and their monthly cloud bills have been getting regular executive attention. The CIO has formed a new FinOps team to address the issue.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how the IBM Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe demo is divided into four sections:\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Getting visibility into multi-cloud deployments and costs <br/>\n2. Rightsizing compute instances <br/>\n3. Optimizing storage volumes <br/>\n4. Leveraging cloud provider discounts <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s start with some basics. In the public cloud (pay-as-you-go) model, the total spend is calculated by multiplying the resources you're consuming by the rate you're paying. Therefore, cloud cost savings can be realized by either reducing consumption or lowering your rate.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s look at how Turbonomic can help with both.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Visualizing a multi-cloud deployment</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Get visibility into the cloud deployment** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can do any cost optimization, they must get a global view into the workloads. Turbonomic automatically creates a service graph that models the dynamic relationships of the workloads and their dependent infrastructure layers. This provides a full stack view from the application down to all the dependent cloud resources. <br/><br/> The application view presents the environment in the context of the business applications. Let's look at the cloud view. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Log in to the **Turbonomic** instance. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Select the **CLOUD** view. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Highlight the categories of entites. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-3-A.png\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | There are three categories of entities: <br/><br/> • Entities that represent the *application workload* (1) <br/> • Entities that represent the *supporting infrastructure*, such as containers and virtual machines (2) <br/> • Entities related to the *public cloud*, such as regions and availability zones (3) <br/><br/> Since the bank is dealing with the cloud, let’s start by examining the 'Region' entity. A Region is a logical grouping of physical availability zones that are in close geographical proximity. A 'Region' is comprised of one or more zones. A 'Zone' represents an Availability Zone in your public cloud account or subscription. A Zone is a location within a given region that serves as a data center. <br/><br/> The current service view shows there are 90 Regions and 173 Availability Zones. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Select the **Region** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-2-a.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s get a high-level understanding of the geographical spread of the bank's workloads across these 90 Regions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Click **LIST OF REGIONS**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-5-A.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This chart lists out the 90 Regions from both AWS and Azure, along with the workloads running in a given region. Let’s take a look at the AWS workloads. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Click the **FILTER** icon. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-4.png\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.7 | Set the filter to: **Cloud Provider** (1), **equals** (2), and **AWS** (3). Click **APPLY** (4). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-7-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We see that most workloads are concentrated primarily in three regions: US East Ohio, US East Northern Virginia, and US West Oregon. There are also several regions that contain minimal to zero workloads running. This information is important because it can help the bank make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchasing pre-paid programmatic discounts, such as regional or zonal reserved instances, for maximum benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.8 | Click **X** to exit the cloud region view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-6.png\" width=\"50\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Identify the top accounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before the bank can make any cloud cost optimization decisions, they must understand several aspects of the cloud estate. Their cloud environment is highly dynamic. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is highly inefficient, nonoptimal, and unscalable. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | In the **Top Accounts** chart, highlight the values under the **30-Day Cost** (1) and **Potential Savings** (2) columns of the **EA - Development** row. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Top Accounts chart lists the most utilized public cloud accounts and their estimated monthly costs. The example above shows that taking the recommended actions can result in a potential savings of close to 10%. Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge absolute savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** chart, highlight the **total potential monthly savings** inside the donut chart (1) and the **breakdown** list (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-2-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the donut chart provides an estimate of the total potential monthly savings that can be realized by collectively addressing overprovisioning, eliminating waste, and purchasing reservations. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> The list on the right provides a more granular breakdown. Let’s take a closer look. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing (downsizing) recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – it could be as much as 50%. Hence, it is logical that a cloud cost optimization effort starts with optimizing the choices around compute resources. Lift and shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables an ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency with minimal residual waste. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by optimizing compute resources. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-1-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Highlight the details behind the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed for the bank to realize their potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three actions: <br/><br/> • Scale (1): Mentions the efficiency actions of scaling down costs that can be done to address overprovisioning on compute instances, storage volumes, and PaaS resources like database servers <br/> • Delete (2): Provides recommendations to get rid of unattached storage <br/> • Buy (3): Recommends additional purchases of reserved instances to further reduce the operational cost of the cloud workloads <br/><br/> The 'Total Savings' (4) represent the cost reduction that the bank can gain by accepting and executing all the 'Scale' actions recommended on the identified compute instances. <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance [*m5.4xlarge EC2*] is highly underutilized, as derived by the platform based on the observation period (1). A recommendation is being made to scale down to a different instance [*r5a.2xlarge*] (2). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (3), and there will be no change in the memory utilization (4). Making the recommended change will decrease the on-demand rate (5) and on-demand monthly cost (6). This would result in an approximate savings of $230.57 for this one instance (7). <br/><br/> Based on this, the bank can easily extrapolate a total savings based on the scale of their deployment. It is also important to note that the potential savings are on the on-demand rate. Later in the demo, we will explore how this rate can be potentially further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The 'Execute Action' button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump across disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to exit the Action Details page. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-5-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | These optimization calculations need to be performed in real time across large-scale deployments at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are unable to keep up and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast with these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing the bank with updated recommendations based on the lastest technological offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | All workloads typically have a need to persist data. There are three forms of cloud storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. <br/><br/> This demo is focused on block storage. Block storage functions like an external disk to the compute instance. It provides low-latency durability for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> All cloud workloads are not the same. Transaction processing workloads have a different storage requirement than log processing or streaming video workloads. At a very general level, there are two categories of block storage: solid state backed devices and magnetic backed devices. <br/><br/> Solid state drives (SDDs) are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads. On the other hand, hard disk drives (HDDs) are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> When choosing a storage service as a part of the bank's deployment, it is important that these selections be made based on the workload characteristics at hand. It has been observed very often that: <br/><br/> 1.\tCompute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2.\tStorage services are grossly overprovisioned. <br/> 3. The storage choices are not compatible with workload characteristics, and this results in suboptimal performance and cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. <br/><br/> By looking at the Volume entity in the global supply chain, we can see that there are about 1000 odd storage volumes in this environment. The proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow is an indicator that about half of the environment is operating correctly. At a global level, the bank can tell there are significant opportunities to improve the cost efficiency of storage, and there are areas of performance improvement as well. Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Highlight the **Storage Summary** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-2-A.png\" width=\"450\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (1), total monthly cost of these volumes (2), and potential monthly savings that can be realized (3). The Unattached Storage bar (4) shows that close to 30% of storage is unused. <br/><br/> Let’s take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-1-A.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** panel, click **Volumes** under the **DELETE** action category. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTIONS</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart mentions the specific volumes that are unattached, including the number of days it has been unattached. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. Here, the savings that can be obtained from Azure is double that of AWS. The chart also computes the bank's total savings, assuming they take all the recommended actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days (1), and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button (2). <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTIONS</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-4.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides supporting details behind the recommendation. It also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action is manually reversible once taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-5-A.png\" width=\"200\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s examine the bank's cost savings opportunities from moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for the workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The bank needs to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost-reduction opportunities using its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** action category, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-1-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the bank's projected savings if either, all, or each recommended action is taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This particular volume is underutilized from an IOPS and throughput perspective. Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, the analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk. This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS and an overprovisioning of as much as 10X. The analytics also compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Potential Savings** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Not all workloads are the same. Transaction workloads that do a lot of I/O and require low latency are best suited for SSD-based storage. On the other hand, sequentially oriented workloads, such as log processing or streaming workloads, are better suited for HDD-based storage. <br/><br/> By analyzing and understanding their workload data access patterns, the bank can make cost-efficient trade-offs on storage choices, such as storage type, capacity, and IOPS. Automatically executing the platform-derived cost optimization actions using an automation policy enables the bank to realize the savings at the earliest. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Understand current pre-paid commitments** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We've seen two primary ways in which the bank can reduce consumption: proactively eliminating waste and rightsizing capacity. In a pay-as-you-go cloud model, this directly impacts the usage levels and therefore has a direct consequence on the cloud bill. However, recall that the other side to this cloud spend equation is the rate for these resources. <br/><br/> All cloud providers offer discounts (up to 70% of the on-demand prices) in exchange for commitments of usage. These discounts can greatly reduce the rates, and it is financially beneficial for the bank to run as many workloads under these discounts. Since these are commitments, any unused capacity will be lost. <br/><br/> Keeping track of reservations, monitoring utilization levels, and planning for additional purchases require strong and continuous governance. Doing all this across a growing multi-cloud environment cannot be easily done manually. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the Turbonomic platform can serve as a decision-support tool when dealing with pre-paid capacity. As always, the first step to rate optimization is to get visibility into existing pre-paid reservations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | On the global cloud view, click **SHOW ALL** in the **Discount Inventory** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-1-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Highlight the **Discount Inventory** details. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-2.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Discount Inventory table shows the bank's discounted pricing commitments with their cloud providers. Each cloud provider is on a separate tab. Let's explore the AWS Reserved Instances tab. <br/><br/> Above the table, we can see the total number of reserved instances (RIs), monthly cost, and monthly savings. In the table, each row represents an individual reservation, and the columns show the basic information about the RI - all discovered from the bank's cloud provider. <br/><br/> At a high level, we can see which accounts own the reservation, the instance type covered by this reservation, and other details, such as whether it is a standard or convertible RI. The 'Est. Savings' and 'Effective Cost' columns are very helpful to quantify the bank's ROI from purchasing these RIs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click **X** to close the **Discount Inventory** details table. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-1-3-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine utilization levels of existing discounts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When used properly, RIs can deliver up to 70% off on-demand prices. RIs that aren't consumed during the commitment period are forfeited. Hence, an awareness of what reservations the bank owns and how well they are utilized is necessary to maximize their ROI. Let’s take a look at RI utilization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | In the **Discount Utilization** chart, hover over the **AWS RI** data point on the black vertical line. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-2-1-A.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The graph shows the bank's reservation utilization data pulled from their cloud providers. Data points to the left of the vertical line represent historical data, while data points to the right are projections into the future. AWS uses Normalized Factor Units (NFU), and Azure uses ratios as a uniform unit of measure of compute capacity to help combine and compare capacity across different instance types. <br/><br/> The graph shows current utilization at around 8% and Azure at around 73%. As part of the optimization process, it is projected that reservation utilization levels will increase to 60% and 90% for AWS and Azure respectively. <br/><br/> Recall the bank's underlying goal here is to maximize the utilization of their inventory and cover as many workloads as possible. In this way, they can take advantage of these highly discounted prices and reduce their total cost of ownership. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.3** | **Explore the additional RI purchase recommendations** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | In the **Recommended RI Purchases** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-1-A.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row for additional information. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-2-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Reservations require a commitment and cost money. An all-upfront reservation provides the largest return, but it requires the full payment at the time of purchase. This is a bit contrary to the pay-as-you-go cloud model. However, over the committed term of one or three years, Turbonomic computes the break-even point, which is the time when the amortized cost of RIs will be better than paying the on-demand prices. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Highlight the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-3.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Based on its analysis of the existing workloads, Turbonomic makes recommendations to purchase additional RIs to increase coverage of workloads that can run at highly discounted prices. <br/><br/> When configuring Turbonomic, the bank needs to set up a purchase profile indicating their preferences. Those preferences are then taken into account when making the recommendations on RI terms, such as one or three years, or RI class, such as standard or convertible. <br/><br/> The bank's estimated savings from purchasing these discounts can be as much as 42%. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.4 | Click **X** to close the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-4-A.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.5 | Click **X** to close the **Reserved Instances** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/4-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we've seen how the Turbonomic platform helps the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank control their cloud costs. While cost optimization is important, it should not be done at the expense of application performance. Gen-Z can leverage the Turbonomic platform to get a deeper visibility into their cloud deployment. They can use platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, right-fit storage layer architectural choices, and automate the execution of these analytics where appropriate - to ensure their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/demo-script-sandbox.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
