Their main mission is to become the one-stop shop for young professionals. They provide a growing array of services, starting from educational services, financial planning, student loan processing, investments, and insurance, among others that are in the planning stages. Each of these services are supported by relatively autonomous teams. Gen-Z Bank has most of its services currently deployed to an on-prem data center. The new CEO is a big proponent of public cloud and its associated benefits of elasticity, OpEx model, and potential for costs savings. He instituted a cloud-first strategy a year or so ago, requiring all workloads to be lifted-and-shifted to the cloud within 18 months. All new workloads are required to use cloud-native principles. \n\n<br/>\n\nThe rising and unpredictable monthly cloud bills are beginning to get the attention of the CFO. The finance team cannot easily tell whether the costs are optimal and where and savings can be realized without risking application performance and availability.   \n\n<br/>\n\nGen-Z has been looking for help and are very interested in learning how IBM can help them.\n\n<br/>\n\nAt the very core, cloud cost optimization is about reducing the consumption of cloud resources and getting the best deal on the rate you pay for each of these resources. More broadly, a cloud cost optimization exercise will follow the following steps:\n\n<br/>\n\n• First, we need to get visibility into which workloads and  accounts are consuming resources and how <br/>\n• Second, we can get quick wins by going after low hanging fruit by eliminating obvious waste <br/>\n• Third, we need to identify over-provisioned resource, matching workloads to best fit resources types <br/>\n• Fourth, seek out opportunities to minimize overpaying by leveraging discounts effectively <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nMany organizations make the mistake of looking for optimization opportunities after receiving the monthly bill. It is important to understand that the above steps should be conducted continuously and in real-time to realize most gains and return on effort.\n\n<br/>\n\n**SCOPE OF THIS DEMO**\n\n<br/>\n\nCloud cost optimization is a very broad domain. It can range from things things like refactoring monoliths to microservices, replacing expensive backend resources with their cheaper cloud provider-managed services (e.g., Oracle with PostGres), architecting to minimize data transfer costs, and establishing a tagging architecture for better governance. Topics such as these are important and relevant but considered advanced topics and better covered in a follow-on demo.\n\n<br/>\n\nThis demo is scoped to focus only on the four core foundational aspects of a cloud cost optimization exercise.\n\n<br/>\n\nMany organizations make the mistake of looking for optimization opportunities after receiving the monthly bill.

Turbonomic builds this resource dependency map, also called the supply chain, by introspecting the configured AWS cloud target. It builds a top-down view starting with the cloud bill and the known AWS accounts. Turbonomic also constructs a bottom-up, operational view by introspecting the resources consumed by the relevant cloud services.
