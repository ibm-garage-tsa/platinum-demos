The bank has just wrapped up its multi-year cloud transformation initiative. All mission-critical workloads were successfully lifted and shifted to either AWS or Azure. Their monthly cloud bill has been getting regular executive attention. The CIO has formed a new FinOps team to address the issue.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how IBM Turbonomic platform can help the FinOps team at Gen-Z bank with their cloud cost optimization efforts.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe demo is divided into the following four sections:\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Getting visibility into multi-cloud deployments and costs <br/>\n2. Rightsizing compute instances <br/>\n3. Optimizing storage volumes <br/>\n4. Leveraging reservations to optimize rates <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s start with some basics. In the pay-as-you-go cloud model, the total spend is computed as the resources you're consuming times the rate you're paying.\n\n<br/>\n\nCloud cost savings can be realized by reducing consumption and/or lowering your rate.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s look at how Turbonomic can help with both.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Visualizing a multi-cloud deployment</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Get visibility into your cloud estate** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before we can do any cost optimization it is necessary to get a global view into the workloads. Turbonomic automatically creates a service graph that models the dynamic relationships of the workloads and their dependent infrastructure layers. This provides a full-stack view from the application down to all the dependent cloud resources. The Application view presents your environment in the context of your business applications. Since the focus of this demo is on cloud cost optimization, we will start from the cloud view. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Log in to the Turbonomic instance. Select the **CLOUD** view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-1-.jpg\" width=\"700\" /> |\n| **Narration** | There are three broad categories of entities: <br/><br/> • Entities that represent the application workload <br/> • Entities that represent the supporting infrastructure like containers and virtual machines <br/> • Entities related to the public cloud <br/><br/> Since we are dealing with the cloud. let’s start looking by examining the Region entity. <br/><br/> A region represents a geographical area. A region is comprised of one or more zones. A zone represents an Availability Zone (AZ) in your public cloud account or subscription. A zone is a location within a given region that serves as a datacenter to host the workloads that run in your environment. <br/><br/> The current service view shows there are 90 regions and 173 AZs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Select the **Region** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-2-a.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s get a high-level understanding of the geographical spread of our workloads across these 90 regions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Click **LIST OF REGIONS**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-3-A.jpg\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This chart lists out the 90 cloud regions from both AWS and Azure, along with the workloads running in a given region. Let’s take a look at the AWS workloads. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Click the **FILTER** icon. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-4-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Set the filter to: **Cloud Provider** (1), **equals** (2), and **AWS** (3). Click **APPLY** (4). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Most workloads are concentrated primarily in the following regions: US East Ohio, US East Northern Virginia, and US West Oregon. There are also several regions that contain minimal to 0 workloads running. This information is important because it can help us make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchase pre-paid programmatic discounts, like regional or zonal reserved instances, for maximum benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Click **X** to exit the cloud region view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-6-A.jpg\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Get a global view of your cloud estate** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before we are able to make any cloud cost optimization decisions, it is necessary to understand several aspects of the cloud estate. The cloud environment is highly dynamic. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help us better focus our cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is not optimal, highly inefficient, and certainly not scalable. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Highlight the **Top Accounts** chart. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-1-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Top Accounts chart lists the most utilized public cloud accounts. The chart also shows an estimate of the monthly cost for each. The example above also shows that a potential savings of close to 10% can be realized if the recommended actions are taken. Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge absolute savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Highlight the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the circle provides an estimate of the total potential monthly savings that can be realized by collectively addressing overprovisioning, eliminating waste, and purchasing reservations. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> The list on the right provides a more granular breakdown. Let’s take a closer look. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing (downsizing) recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – it could be as much as 50%. Hence, it is logical that a cloud cost optimization exercise starts with optimizing the choices around compute. Lift and shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables an ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency with minimal residual waste. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by optimizing compute resources. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Highlight the details behind the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed to realize the potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three actions: <br/><br/> • SCALE (1): Enumerates the scaling down cost efficiency actions that can be done to address over-provisioning on compute instance, storage volumes, and PaaS resources like database servers <br/> • DELETE (2): Recommended to get rid of unattached storage <br/> • BUY (3): Recommends additional purchases of reserved instances to further reduce the operational cost of the cloud workloads <br/><br/> The TOTAL SAVINGS (4) represent the cost reduction that can be gained by accepting and executing all the SCALE actions recommended on the identified compute instances <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-31-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance (*m5.4xlarge EC2*) is highly underutilized, as derived by the platform based on the percentile math of the observation period (1). A recommendation is being made to scale down to a different instance (*r5a.2xlarge*). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (2). There will be no change in the memory utilization (3). <br/><br/> Making the instance family changes as recommended will drop the on-demand rate to a little less than half (4). This will essentially halve the cost of this instance. The on-demand rate will decrease by approximately 41% (5). This will result in an approximate savings of $230.57 just for this once instance (6). <br/><br/> Based on this, one can easily extrapolate a total savings based on the scale of your deployment. It is also important to note that the potential savings are on the on-demand rate. Later in the demo, we will explore how this rate can be potentially further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The EXECUTE ACTION button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump across disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to exit the Action Details page. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-31-B.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | It is important to recognize that performing these optimization calculations in real time across large-scale deployments needs to be done at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are unable to keep up and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast with these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing you with updated recommendations based on the lastest technological offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization next. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | All workloads typically have a need to persist data. There are basically three forms of cloud storage: <br/><br/> 1. Object storage <br/> 2. File storage <br/> 3. Block storage <br/><br/> The demo is focused on block storage. Block storage functions like an external disk to the compute instance. It provides low-latency durability for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> All cloud workloads are not the same. Transaction processing workloads have a different storage requirement than log processing or streaming video workloads. At a very general level, there are two broad categories of block storage: <br/><br/> 1. Solid state backed devices <br/> 2. Magnetic backed devices <br/><br/> Whereas solid state drives (SDDs) are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads, hard disk drives (HDDs) are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> When choosing a storage service as a part of your deployment, it is important that these selections be made based on the workload characteristics at hand. Very often it has been observed that: <br/><br/> 1.\tCompute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2.\tStorage services are grossly overprovisioned. <br/> 3. The storage choices made are not compatible with workload characteristics, resulting in suboptimal performance and cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. <br/><br/> By looking at the Volume entity in the global supply chain, we can observe that there are about 1000 odd storage volumes in this environment. The proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow is an indicator that about half of the environment is operating correctly. At a global level, we can tell there are significant opportunities to improve the cost efficiency of storage, and there are areas of performance improvement as well. Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities at a more granular level. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Highlight the storage volume usage at a global level. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (2), as well as the total costs of these volumes and potential monthly savings that can be realized (2). The UNATTACHED STORAGE chart (3) shows that close to 30% of storage is unused. Ironically and interestingly, many industry surveys across a large cross section of cloud users put unused cloud resources at about 26%. Let’s move on to take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-1-A.jpg\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** panel, click **Volumes** under the **DELETE** action category. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart enumerates the specific volumes that are unattached, including the number of days it has been unattached. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. In this example, the savings that can be obtained from Azure is double that of AWS. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The chart also computes the total savings, assuming all recommended actions are taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days as shown, and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides supporting details behind the recommendation. It also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action once take is manually reversible. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-4-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We are now back on the main Potential Savings chart. Let’s move on to examine the cost savings opportunities delivered by moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for your workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Architects need to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. It is very common that these choices follow the traditional practices of playing safe by overprovisioning. In some cases, these choices are made without a proper understanding of workload patterns. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost-reduction opportunities via its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** category, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-1.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the projected savings if either, all, or each recommended action is taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Highlight the analytics on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This particular volume is underutilized from an IOPS and throughput perspective. Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk. This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS and an overprovisioning of as much as 10X. The analytics also compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-4-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Not all workloads are the same. Transaction workloads that do a lot of I/O and require low latency are best suited for SSD-based storage. On the other hand, sequentially oriented workloads, such as log processing or streaming workloads, are better suited for HDD-based storage. <br/><br/> In summary, as far as storage is concerned, analyze and understand your workload data access patterns to enable you to make cost-efficient trade-offs on storage choices, such as storage type, capacity, and IOPS. Keep an constant eye out for waste and optimization recommendations. Lastly, the platform-derived cost optimization actions should ideally be automatically executed via an automation policy, so the savings can be realized at the earliest. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Examine current reserved instance coverage** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Need narration |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Need action |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine current reserved instance inventory levels** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | Need action |\n| **Narration** | Observe that you are in the default Application view.

This information is important because it can help us make decisions about consolidating workloads in a given region and purchase pre-paid programmatic discounts, like regional or zonal reserved instances, for maximum benefit. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Click **X** to exit the cloud region view. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-1-6-A.jpg\" width=\"100\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now that we're back in the default global cloud view, let’s examine the various summary charts. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Get a global view of your cloud estate** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Before we are able to make any cloud cost optimization decisions, it is necessary to understand several aspects of the cloud estate. The cloud environment is highly dynamic. Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help us better focus our cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously is not optimal, highly inefficient, and certainly not scalable. <br/><br/> Let’s take a look at some of these charts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Highlight the **Top Accounts** chart. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-1-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Top Accounts chart lists the most utilized public cloud accounts. The chart also shows an estimate of the monthly cost for each. The example above also shows that a potential savings of close to 10% can be realized if the recommended actions are taken. Saving 10-30% in a large-scale cloud environment can yield huge absolute savings. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Highlight the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/1-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The number inside the circle provides an estimate of the total potential monthly savings that can be realized by collectively addressing overprovisioning, eliminating waste, and purchasing reservations. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/> The list on the right provides a more granular breakdown. Let’s take a closer look. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Rightsizing compute instances</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing (downsizing) recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Compute resources are often the biggest line item on a cloud bill – it could be as much as 50%. Hence, it is logical that a cloud cost optimization exercise starts with optimizing the choices around compute. Lift and shift cloud migration strategies typically employ the legacy on-prem model of grossly oversizing their resources. The elastic scaling of the cloud, however, now enables an ability to continuously balance capacity and demand in real time, yielding higher cost efficiency with minimal residual waste. <br/><br/> Let’s start by exploring the potential savings that can be realized by optimizing compute resources. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **SHOW ALL** on the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Highlight the details behind the **Potential Savings** chart. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This table categorizes the specific actions that need to be executed to realize the potential savings. Notice the savings actions are classified into three actions: <br/><br/> • SCALE (1): Enumerates the scaling down cost efficiency actions that can be done to address over-provisioning on compute instance, storage volumes, and PaaS resources like database servers <br/> • DELETE (2): Recommended to get rid of unattached storage <br/> • BUY (3): Recommends additional purchases of reserved instances to further reduce the operational cost of the cloud workloads <br/><br/> The TOTAL SAVINGS (4) represent the cost reduction that can be gained by accepting and executing all the SCALE actions recommended on the identified compute instances <br/><br/> Let’s examine the details behind the first virtual machine scaling action. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-31-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The current instance (*m5.4xlarge EC2*) is highly underutilized, as derived by the platform based on the percentile math of the observation period (1). A recommendation is being made to scale down to a different instance (*r5a.2xlarge*). If this action is taken, the instance utilization will increase from 16% to 31.6% (2). There will be no change in the memory utilization (3). <br/><br/> Making the instance family changes as recommended will drop the on-demand rate to a little less than half (4). This will essentially halve the cost of this instance. The on-demand rate will decrease by approximately 41% (5). This will result in an approximate savings of $230.57 just for this once instance (6). <br/><br/> Based on this, one can easily extrapolate a total savings based on the scale of your deployment. It is also important to note that the potential savings are on the on-demand rate. Later in the demo, we will explore how this rate can be potentially further optimized by leveraging programmatic discounts like reservations. <br/><br/> The EXECUTE ACTION button demonstrates the ability of the Turbonomic platform to execute the recommendations natively from the platform. This provides the IT Ops teams the convenience to act immediately and realize cost savings instantaneously. Moreover, it enhances operational efficiency by avoiding the need to jump across disparate tools and management consoles to implement a cost savings recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Click **X** to exit the Action Details page. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/2-1-31-B.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | It is important to recognize that performing these optimization calculations in real time across large-scale deployments needs to be done at CPU speed. Manual operator-driven optimization processes are unable to keep up and do not scale. <br/><br/> Moreover, cloud service providers keep introducing new instance families to improve capabilities and price performance. The Turbonomic platform keeps abreast with these innovations and adds them to its analytics engine, providing you with updated recommendations based on the lastest technological offerings. <br/><br/> Let’s shift gears and look at storage cost optimization next. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Optimizing storage</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Get a global view of storage consumption** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | All workloads typically have a need to persist data. There are basically three forms of cloud storage: <br/><br/> 1. Object storage <br/> 2. File storage <br/> 3. Block storage <br/><br/> The demo is focused on block storage. Block storage functions like an external disk to the compute instance. It provides low-latency durability for cloud workloads. <br/><br/> All cloud workloads are not the same. Transaction processing workloads have a different storage requirement than log processing or streaming video workloads. At a very general level, there are two broad categories of block storage: <br/><br/> 1. Solid state backed devices <br/> 2. Magnetic backed devices <br/><br/> Whereas solid state drives (SDDs) are good for low-latency, heavy IOPS types of workloads, hard disk drives (HDDs) are good for high throughput sequential workloads. <br/><br/> When choosing a storage service as a part of your deployment, it is important that these selections be made based on the workload characteristics at hand. Very often it has been observed that: <br/><br/> 1.\tCompute instances are stopped, but the storage volumes are forgotten. This results in orphaned volumes, which then results in residual and accumulating waste. <br/> 2.\tStorage services are grossly overprovisioned. <br/> 3. The storage choices made are not compatible with workload characteristics, resulting in suboptimal performance and cost overruns. <br/><br/> Let’s start exploring the storage optimization opportunities in this environment. <br/><br/> By looking at the Volume entity in the global supply chain, we can observe that there are about 1000 odd storage volumes in this environment. The proportion of green vs. red vs. yellow is an indicator that about half of the environment is operating correctly. At a global level, we can tell there are significant opportunities to improve the cost efficiency of storage, and there are areas of performance improvement as well. Let’s drill down to better understand these cost reduction opportunities at a more granular level. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **Volume** entity. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-1-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Highlight the storage volume usage at a global level. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-1-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Storage Summary chart shows the number of volumes (2), as well as the total costs of these volumes and potential monthly savings that can be realized (2). The UNATTACHED STORAGE chart (3) shows that close to 30% of storage is unused. Ironically and interestingly, many industry surveys across a large cross section of cloud users put unused cloud resources at about 26%. Let’s move on to take a deeper look at which specific volumes can be reclaimed. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Reclaim waste** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Potential Savings** chart, click **SHOW ALL**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-1-A.jpg\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | In the **Potential Savings** panel, click **Volumes** under the **DELETE** action category. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The chart enumerates the specific volumes that are unattached, including the number of days it has been unattached. The data for each cloud provider appears on a separate tab. In this example, the savings that can be obtained from Azure is double that of AWS. Volumes that are unattached for many days are good candidates to reclaim and gain some savings. The chart also computes the total savings, assuming all recommended actions are taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | On the **AWS** tab, select the first row which has a volume unattached for 14 days as shown, and click the corresponding **DETAILS** button. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Highlight the **Action Details**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do <strong>NOT</strong> click the <strong>EXECUTE ACTION</strong> button, as this is a shared demo environment.</InlineNotification> <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Action Details panel provides supporting details behind the recommendation. It also shows whether the action can be taken immediately, whether downtime is required, and whether the action once take is manually reversible. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-2-4-A.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We are now back on the main Potential Savings chart. Let’s move on to examine the cost savings opportunities delivered by moving volumes to alternate storage tiers that are a better fit for the workloads at hand. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Select the right type of storage for your workloads** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Architects need to choose the right storage volume for their workloads. It is very common that these choices follow the traditional practices of playing safe by overprovisioning. In some cases, these choices are made without a proper understanding of workload patterns. Capacity and performance are two fundamental factors around which these choices should be made. We will see how even if wrong initial choices are made, the Turbonomic platform will detect these optimization and cost-reduction opportunities via its continuous feedback loop. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Under the **SCALE** category, select **Volumes**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-1.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can immediately see the various scale options, along with the projected savings if either, all, or each recommended action is taken. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click **DETAILS** on the first row. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-2-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Highlight the analytics on the **Action Details** panel. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-3-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This particular volume is underutilized from an IOPS and throughput perspective. Based on the actual utilization pattern of this workload, analytics show that this workload does not need an SSD and that the performance requirements of the workload can be met with a cheaper magnetic disk. This workload does not need the provisioned 5000 IOPS and can get by with a much lower 500 IOPS and an overprovisioning of as much as 10X. The analytics also compute the projected cost savings, as represented on the panel. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-4-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.5 | Click **X**. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-3-5-A.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Not all workloads are the same. Transaction workloads that do a lot of I/O and require low latency are best suited for SSD-based storage. On the other hand, sequentially oriented workloads, such as log processing or streaming workloads, are better suited for HDD-based storage. <br/><br/> In summary, as far as storage is concerned, analyze and understand your workload data access patterns to enable you to make cost-efficient trade-offs on storage choices, such as storage type, capacity, and IOPS. Keep an constant eye out for waste and optimization recommendations. Lastly, the platform-derived cost optimization actions should ideally be automatically executed via an automation policy, so the savings can be realized at the earliest. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Leveraging cloud provider discounts</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Examine current reserved instance coverage** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Need narration |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Need action |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Examine current reserved instance inventory levels** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | Need action |\n| **Narration** | Observe that you are in the default Application view.
