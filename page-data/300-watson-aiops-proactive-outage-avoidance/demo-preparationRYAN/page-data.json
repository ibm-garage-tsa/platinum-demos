Register for access to the <a href=\"https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/registration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Center of Competency</a> (CoC).\n\n<br/>\n\n2. Once you get an email confirming your access credentials, go to the CoC's <a href=\"https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/aiops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Watson AIOps</a> cluster page.\n\n<br/>\n\n3. On the cluster page, you will see several clusters. You will be using the **Qui Gon** cluster.\n\n<br/>\n\n<InlineNotification><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Watson AIOps is NOT currently multi-tenant. Therefore, only ONE USER can use the environment at a time. Otherwise, you risk overwriting/undoing other users’ demos. You must reserve your timeslot. The reservations are NOT self-enforcing, meaning it’s up to everyone to adhere to only using the demo during the time you’ve reserved and ensuring you finish up prior to the next person’s time slot.</InlineNotification>\n\n<br/>\n\n4.\tReserve the **Qui Gon** cluster for a self-enablement session by following the steps below:<br/>a.
