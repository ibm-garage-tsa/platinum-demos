Observe the increase in the number of calls, the error rate, latency, and CPU processing time. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Navigate back to the **Instana** tab. Click the **Summary** tab and point out the trends in the primary golden signals. <br/><br/> Point out the increases in both the erroneous call rate (1) and the mean service latency (2).

Watson AIOps also includes recommendations for how to resolve the incident. We can take action directly from the notification and resolve the incident quickly. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Getting notified of an emerging problem</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **AIOps packages the notification along with relevant details as a story** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Notifications are now appearing in Slack. We’re using Slack in this demo, but Watson AIOps also integrates with Microsoft Teams. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps formats the notifications into a “story” using AI to correlate events, metrics, alerts, and logs. Each story brings together the various notifications for all the affected services by the same underlying issue. Imagine if each piece of data presented in the story was a separate notification – we’d quickly be inundated with alerts. <br/><br/> The story is like a home base for action when a problem arises. Instead of manually correlating things across multiple different tools, it’s all right here immediately when the notification is received. <br/><br/> In addition to providing a highly contextualized view of the incident, it enables us to jump to other tools to explore further details. This eliminates tool silos and helps us restore service faster. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Navigate to the tab running **Slack** and examine the incoming story. <br/><br/><InlineNotification>You may need to wait a few minutes for the Slack messages to appear.</InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-2-1-1.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This story is telling us there’s an emerging problem with the Rating service, which is one of the microservices in our Quote of the Day application. <br/><br/> In the background, the AI and ML algorithms of Watson AIOps have done the work for us. It shows which services are affected and presents us with a curated view of relevant information: the events and alerts that are indicative of the symptoms of this problem, anomalies that Watson AIOps has found in the log files, and similar incidents that have occurred in the past. This way, we can see how they were successfully resolved. We’ll explore each of these components in more detail. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Determining which services caused the problem</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Analyze the story** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Based on its intelligent correlation of logs, metrics, and traces, Watson AIOps derives probable causes of the failure. <br/><br/> As we can see in the ChatOps notification here, there is a high-priority issue emerging in the QotD application. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps presents a list of top three probable causes of this incident: a log anomaly in the qotd-rating service, an excessive CPU usage condition, and increasing service call response times. <br/><br/> As more information comes in, Watson AIOps correlates related events and updates the existing story in real time. <br/><br/> Let's dive deeper into the story to examine the supporting details. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click **Show more**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-1.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s unpack the details behind the developing story. We need to find out where the issue began, so we can prevent it from causing cascading failures across the components of the application. <br/><br/> Instead of having to hop between tools to look for alerts, we can see them right here from the notification. Watson AIOps has determined that these events are related, and it provides an explanation for how it determined the relationships. We can see that there are two groups of events based on related resources and the timing of the events. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click **View alerts** to examine the details behind these alerts. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-2.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can inspect the grouped events right here without searching for them in another tool. <br/><br/> It looks like the memory and CPU on the Rating service increased significantly. This is causing a significant slowdown in the response times on both the Rating and Web services. <br/><br/> Based on this information, it seems that the Rating service is the source of the issue. Let’s get a bit more detail – this time from the log files. <br/><br/> Instead of needing to go to Kibana and manually sort through the hundreds or thousands of log entries that come in every minute, Watson AIOps has found several anomalies in the log files and presented them here. <br/><br/> During normal operations, Watson AIOps continually trains on the log files of the application and monitors for deviations from that baseline. We can see that the anomalies are occurring on the Rating service, which fits with what we saw in the alerts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | In the **View alerts** pop-up window, select **Log anomalies** (1) and then **Show more** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/view-alerts-popup.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps gives us additional context on the anomaly. In this case, the ‘error_log’ anomaly is telling us that Watson AIOps has never seen this type of log entry before (hence the 'unknown') and that the log message indicates there is some type of error. Watson AIOps is not only looking at the statistical frequency of the type of log, but it is also using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the content of the log message to give additional context (in this case that there’s likely an error). <br/><br/> Watson AIOps also explains why the anomaly was flagged. It expected to see zero of this type of log, but it actually saw four. <br/><br/> Now we know that there is an unfamiliar log coming from the Rating service, and it’s indicating an error. <br/><br/> This further reinforces what we saw with the alerts - it looks like the Rating service is likely the root cause of this problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.4 | Click **Preview Logs** of **Pattern 1**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification> <strong>Pattern 1</strong> displays '<strong>Unknown pattern. Error message in the pattern</strong>.'</InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-4.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **Back** in the **Log Preview** window. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-5.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | In the **View alerts** pop-up window, select **Alerts** from the drop-down menu options. <br/><br/><InlineNotification>You may need to wait a few minutes for <strong>Alerts</strong> to appear.</InlineNotification> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-6.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | Click **Show more** under the first alert. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-7.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps has detected that the qotd-rating service is consuming an excessive amount of CPU and memory resources. <br/><br/> Under the covers, Watson AIOps is comparing the CPU and memory utilization to the known and learned behaviors of the application. Since it is seemingly straying from the expected behavior, Watson AIOps is flagging the anomaly and correlating it to the current story. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | Click **Close** to exit the **View alerts** pop-up window. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-8.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We have reviewed the log and metric anomalies that have been correlated as part of this story by Watson AIOps. <br/><br/> Now that we have a high-level understanding of the emerging incident and the probable causes, we need to focus on resolving the issue as quickly as possible. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Click the **Abnormal behavior in the logs for component: qotd-rating.

It allows us to examine the specific alerts and understand the topological relationships between the impacted application components. It also helps accelerate incident resolution by recommending specific runbooks that could potentially resolve the current incident. <br/><br/> Before we progress with the incident resolution process, it is important to take ownership of the story.

It helps you quickly determine the probable causes of a failure and proactively alleviate outages, therefore minimizing the business impact of these IT issues on revenue or client experiences. <br/><br/> The anomaly detection capabilities alert you early to potential issues, enabling the SREs to quickly take remedial actions. The intelligent event analytics examine logs, metrics, tickets, and topology and provide a useful correlation that would otherwise be very challenging. Lastly, the AI-driven remediation accelerates problem resolution and significantly reduces the mean time to repair.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"52dd26c3134904d02c8ac66bf186d9db","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":2955},"frontmatter":{"title":"Proactive outage avoidance 300-level live demo","description":"Proactive outage avoidance 300-level live demo","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Proactive outage avoidance\n  300-level live demo\ndescription: Proactive outage avoidance 300-level live demo\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Proactive outage avoidance <br/> 300-level live demo\n  </span> );\n\n![banner](./images/proactive-outage-avoidance-300-script-github-banner.jpg)\n\n<span id=\"top\"></span>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Introduction</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I’ll show you how Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps helps SREs and IT Ops teams proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve incidents across mission-critical workloads.\n\n<br/>\n\nYou’ll see how Watson AIOps:\n\n<br/>\n\n•\tIntelligently correlates multiple disparate sources of information, such as logs, metrics, events, tickets, and topology  <br/>\n•\tCondenses and presents all of this information in actionable alerts instead of large quantities of unrelated alerts <br/>\n•\tResolves problems within seconds to minutes of being notified using Watson AIOps’ automation capabilities <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\nWe will be using an application called Quote of the Day, which is a content delivery app that serves up random quotations.

We’re using Slack in this demo, but Watson AIOps also integrates with Microsoft Teams. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps formats the notifications into a “story” using AI to correlate events, metrics, alerts, and logs. Each story brings together the various notifications for all the affected services by the same underlying issue. Imagine if each piece of data presented in the story was a separate notification – we’d quickly be inundated with alerts. <br/><br/> The story is like a home base for action when a problem arises. Instead of manually correlating things across multiple different tools, it’s all right here immediately when the notification is received. <br/><br/> In addition to providing a highly contextualized view of the incident, it enables us to jump to other tools to explore further details. This eliminates tool silos and helps us restore service faster. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Navigate to the tab running **Slack** and examine the incoming story. <br/><br/><InlineNotification>You may need to wait a few minutes for the Slack messages to appear.</InlineNotification> <br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-2-1-1.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| **Narration** | This story is telling us there’s an emerging problem with the Rating service, which is one of the microservices in our Quote of the Day application. <br/><br/> In the background, the AI and ML algorithms of Watson AIOps have done the work for us. It shows which services are affected and presents us with a curated view of relevant information: the events and alerts that are indicative of the symptoms of this problem, anomalies that Watson AIOps has found in the log files, and similar incidents that have occurred in the past. This way, we can see how they were successfully resolved. We’ll explore each of these components in more detail. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Determining which services caused the problem</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Analyze the story** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Based on its intelligent correlation of logs, metrics, and traces, Watson AIOps derives probable causes of the failure. <br/><br/> As we can see in the ChatOps notification here, there is a high-priority issue emerging in the QotD application. <br/><br/> Watson AIOps presents a list of top three probable causes of this incident: a log anomaly in the qotd-rating service, an excessive CPU usage condition, and increasing service call response times. <br/><br/> As more information comes in, Watson AIOps correlates related events and updates the existing story in real time. <br/><br/> Let's dive deeper into the story to examine the supporting details. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click **Show more**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-1.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s unpack the details behind the developing story. We need to find out where the issue began, so we can prevent it from causing cascading failures across the components of the application. <br/><br/> Instead of having to hop between tools to look for alerts, we can see them right here from the notification. Watson AIOps has determined that these events are related, and it provides an explanation for how it determined the relationships. We can see that there are two groups of events based on related resources and the timing of the events. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click **View alerts** to examine the details behind these alerts. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/Fig-3-1-2.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can inspect the grouped events right here without searching for them in another tool. <br/><br/> It looks like the memory and CPU on the Rating service increased significantly. This is causing a significant slowdown in the response times on both the Rating and Web services. <br/><br/> Based on this information, it seems that the Rating service is the source of the issue. Let’s get a bit more detail – this time from the log files. <br/><br/> Instead of needing to go to Kibana and manually sort through the hundreds or thousands of log entries that come in every minute, Watson AIOps has found several anomalies in the log files and presented them here. <br/><br/> During normal operations, Watson AIOps continually trains on the log files of the application and monitors for deviations from that baseline. We can see that the anomalies are occurring on the Rating service, which fits with what we saw in the alerts. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | In the **View alerts** pop-up window, select **Log anomalies** (1) and then **Show more** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/view-alerts-popup.png\" width=\"400\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson AIOps gives us additional context on the anomaly. In this case, the ‘error_log’ anomaly is telling us that Watson AIOps has never seen this type of log entry before (hence the 'unknown') and that the log message indicates there is some type of error. Watson AIOps is not only looking at the statistical frequency of the type of log, but it is also using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the content of the log message to give additional context (in this case that there’s likely an error). <br/><br/> Watson AIOps also explains why the anomaly was flagged. It expected to see zero of this type of log, but it actually saw four. <br/><br/> Now we know that there is an unfamiliar log coming from the Rating service, and it’s indicating an error. <br/><br/> This further reinforces what we saw with the alerts - it looks like the Rating service is likely the root cause of this problem. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.4 | Click **Preview Logs** of **Pattern 1**. <br/><br/> <InlineNotification> <strong>Pattern 1</strong> displays '<strong>Unknown pattern.

It helps you quickly determine the probable causes of a failure and proactively alleviate outages, therefore minimizing the business impact of these IT issues on revenue or client experiences. <br/><br/> The anomaly detection capabilities alert you early to potential issues, enabling the SREs to quickly take remedial actions. The intelligent event analytics examine logs, metrics, tickets, and topology and provide a useful correlation that would otherwise be very challenging. Lastly, the AI-driven remediation accelerates problem resolution and significantly reduces the mean time to repair.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
