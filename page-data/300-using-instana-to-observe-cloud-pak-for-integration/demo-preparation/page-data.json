The application uses IBM API Connect, IBM App Connect Enterprise and IBM MQ from the Cloud Pak for Integration. |\n| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I), Instana, IBM App Connect Enterprise |\n| **Demo capabilities** | Dependency mapping; Intelligent alerting; Distributed tracing |\n| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/c7h0gc1wy16yyhiy7ygrxad4vj5wl1km\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is a short deck of customer-facing slides that sets the context for the demo. |\n| **Demo script** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/fd0ceiezrh9hjg2fe3gea2ge15y6zwt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see. <br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |\n| **Demo guidance** | The demo environment is set to automatically inject an error into the application once every hour. <br/> <br/>The cycle begins at ten minutes to the hour (so 9:50, 10:50, etc). You should see errors begin to show up a few minutes after this (around 52 or 53 minutes past the hour), with the errors lasting 10 minutes. |\n| **Required versions** | Instana 3.248 |\n| **How to get support** | • Open a support case at <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IBM Technology Zone Help</a> regarding issues with reserving and provisioning Tech Zone environments.<br/>• Contact <a href=\"https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0216F39ACU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#platinumdemos-automation-support</a> regarding issues with setting up and running this demo. |\n\n### **PREPARE TO GIVE THE DEMO**\n\n<InlineNotification>Business partners will need to request access to the environment.
