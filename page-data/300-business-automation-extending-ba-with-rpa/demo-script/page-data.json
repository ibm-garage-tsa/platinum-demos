In the existing process, every request for a new insurance policy must be routed to a policy specialist. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Future Corp’s current quoting process (without RPA) in Process Designer, which you opened during the demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-without-RPA.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | We are looking at the process diagram for Future Corp’s quoting process. Process diagrams are created in Process Designer. Process Designer is used to design and implement the quoting process. Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each new quote. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Execute the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is used by customer service agents to launch new quote requests and work on assigned tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Go to the **Process Portal** tab, which you opened during the demo preparation. Log in as **customerService** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is highly customizable to fit your organization’s look and feel. The responsive user interface provides flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a customer site. It can be tailored though a set of configuration options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/><br/>To request a quote, a customer service representative initiates a new quote request and enters the customer’s policy data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Under **Launch**, click **New Insurance Quote** to start a new quote. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Use the **Get Test Data** button to pre-fill in the form with some test data. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.4 | **Optionally**, change the customer name and the make of the car to make this request unique. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Click **Get Quote** to close the task and submit the new quote request. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | Policy specialists enter the customer data into the policy system and create the quote. They use the Process Portal to organize their tasks and work on the tasks assigned to them. Our specialist has received a new task to prepare the quote.<br/><br/>When the policy specialist receives the quote request, she needs to log into the quoting system to prepare a new quote, which involves manually entering a significant amount of information. This is both time consuming and error prone as the specialist must go field-by-field in order to move all the customer’s data into the quoting system. <br/><br/>Behind the scenes, the quoting process is managed by workflow. Once the policy specialist completes this task, the system waits for the customer’s response. If the customer accepts the quote, the policy specialist will again log into the quoting system to establish a new insurance policy for the customer. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.6 | (Still on the Process Portal) Log out (as **customerService**), and then log in as **policy1** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA6.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.7 | Run the most recent **Prepare New Quote** task by clicking the task name. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA7.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.8 | Open the legacy quoting app by using the shortcut in the bottom right of the taskbar to click **FCQS_2021.jar**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA8.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.9 | Log in to the quoting app (any username and password will work). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA9.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.10 | Show the task UI and the quoting app to make the point that the quote data must be manually entered into the quoting app. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA10.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Adding an RPA bot to the workflow</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Introduce the workflow process with RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now let’s look at how we can incorporate RPA to reduce that manual work. Here is a new version of the quoting workflow. The workflow is the same except we’ve modified the middle swim lane. Instead of assigning the tasks to a policy specialist, we route them directly to a bot for immediate execution. Just as with the original workflow, when there is a quoting exception, the quote request is routed to a policy specialist for resolution. For example, certain car models such as Audi and BMW require manual review to generate a quote. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Open the process diagram for the quoting process with RPA in Process Designer. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | You will see the following process diagram. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Bot authoring: Launch the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s RPA capabilities, Future Corp was able to easily build and deploy software robots, or bots, that automatically enter customer data into the quoting system. This enabled Future Corp to automate repetitive tasks such as creating customer quotes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Go to **RPA Studio**, which you opened during preparation, with the **Get Quote.wal** file opened to the **GetQuote** routine. |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s low code bot authoring environment, Future Corp easily built and tested their bots. Hundreds of pre-built commands are available to assemble bots using intuitive wizards.<br/><br/>Without RPA, policy specialists would had to manually copy and paste customer data into the quoting system. With RPA, Future Corp created a bot to connect to the quoting system, fill in the extracted information and email the quote to the customer once it is available. <br/><br/>Here we see some of the bot commands they used. First, the quoting application is opened. Next, the username and password are entered. Commands were used to open the quoting application, enter user name and password, and generate a new quote.<br/><br/>Now let’s see how to build the quote bot from scratch. First, we’ll use the Launch and Attach Window command to open the quoting application.<br/><br/><InlineNotification>The following build from scratch steps are simple, but intricate. Be sure to practice these steps so you can master your demo delivery.</InlineNotification> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.2 | To start creating a new bot, click **New** (1) (not the down arrow). Select **Wal File** (2), and then click **Create** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/script-image2.2.2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.3 | In the Toolbox search bar, type **attach** (1) and find the **Launch and Attach Window** (2) command. Drag it out to the script window. Set the executable parameter to the **C:\\FutureCorp\\FCQS_2021.jar** (3) file and click **Save** (4). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/script-image2.2.3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | RPA Studio allows you to immediately run the bot commands. The debugging mode enables you to control the bot's operation, test commands, track variables, and debug scripts on remote computers. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.4 | In the toolbar ribbon, click **Start** to run the bot. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.5 | The **Focus Corp Quoting System** will appear. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.3** | **Bot authoring: Log in to the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The recorder assists in creating your script. With the recorder, you can select user interface components to enter commands in your script. Let’s build the commands to log into the quoting application. First, we'll record the user name field. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1 | In the toolbar ribbon, click **Start Recorder** to capture keystrokes from the quoting app. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.2 | Hold the **control** key and mouse over the **User Name** field (1) in the quoting app. Release the control key once the field highlights in red.

Just like the bots we've just built, Future Corp’s chatbot is assembled by dragging and dropping commands and configuring them using pop-up property sheets. Since chatbot capabilities are fully integrated, Future Corp was able to build their bots and chatbots using one single tool. Chatbot commands can be inserted anywhere inside the bot script. For example, the Bot Ask and Answer command asks the user a question in a chat and recognizes the answer using a knowledge base prepared for the chat subject. The Bot Ask Email command asks for and acknowledges a user-entered email. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Open the RPA window, click on the **Ingrid Insurance.wal** tab, and search for chatbot commands by typing **bot** into the toolbox search. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Bot Ask and Answer command is used to have the bot ask the customer a question in a chat.

In the existing process, every request for a new insurance policy must be routed to a policy specialist. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Future Corp’s current quoting process (without RPA) in Process Designer, which you opened during the demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-without-RPA.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | We are looking at the process diagram for Future Corp’s quoting process. Process diagrams are created in Process Designer. Process Designer is used to design and implement the quoting process. Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each new quote. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Execute the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is used by customer service agents to launch new quote requests and work on assigned tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Go to the **Process Portal** tab, which you opened during the demo preparation. Log in as **customerService** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is highly customizable to fit your organization’s look and feel. The responsive user interface provides flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a customer site. It can be tailored though a set of configuration options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/><br/>To request a quote, a customer service representative initiates a new quote request and enters the customer’s policy data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Under **Launch**, click **New Insurance Quote** to start a new quote. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Use the **Get Test Data** button to pre-fill in the form with some test data. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.4 | **Optionally**, change the customer name and the make of the car to make this request unique. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Click **Get Quote** to close the task and submit the new quote request. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | Policy specialists enter the customer data into the policy system and create the quote. They use the Process Portal to organize their tasks and work on the tasks assigned to them. Our specialist has received a new task to prepare the quote.<br/><br/>When the policy specialist receives the quote request, she needs to log into the quoting system to prepare a new quote, which involves manually entering a significant amount of information. This is both time consuming and error prone as the specialist must go field-by-field in order to move all the customer’s data into the quoting system. <br/><br/>Behind the scenes, the quoting process is managed by workflow. Once the policy specialist completes this task, the system waits for the customer’s response.

Here is a new version of the quoting workflow. The workflow is the same except we’ve modified the middle swim lane. Instead of assigning the tasks to a policy specialist, we route them directly to a bot for immediate execution. Just as with the original workflow, when there is a quoting exception, the quote request is routed to a policy specialist for resolution. For example, certain car models such as Audi and BMW require manual review to generate a quote. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Open the process diagram for the quoting process with RPA in Process Designer. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | You will see the following process diagram. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Bot authoring: Launch the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s RPA capabilities, Future Corp was able to easily build and deploy software robots, or bots, that automatically enter customer data into the quoting system.

Hundreds of pre-built commands are available to assemble bots using intuitive wizards.<br/><br/>Without RPA, policy specialists would had to manually copy and paste customer data into the quoting system. With RPA, Future Corp created a bot to connect to the quoting system, fill in the extracted information and email the quote to the customer once it is available. <br/><br/>Here we see some of the bot commands they used. First, the quoting application is opened. Next, the username and password are entered. Commands were used to open the quoting application, enter user name and password, and generate a new quote.<br/><br/>Now let’s see how to build the quote bot from scratch.

The Bot Ask Email command asks for and acknowledges a user-entered email. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Open the RPA window, click on the **Ingrid Insurance.wal** tab, and search for chatbot commands by typing **bot** into the toolbox search. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Bot Ask and Answer command is used to have the bot ask the customer a question in a chat. The answer is recognized using a knowledge base prepared for the chat subject. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Open the **Bot Ask and Answer** command in the bot script. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Show how the command is connected to a knowledge base. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.2** | **Train a knowledge base** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Bot Studio includes the machine learning model builder used by Future Corp for creating and training the knowledge base. Future Corp’s RPA team found training the knowledge base to be very simple. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | If the **Knowledge Bases** tab is not visible, click the **Tools** tab (1) on the menu ribbon, then click **Knowledge Base Training** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot3a.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.2 | Next, open the knowledge base definition.

To the right, the related questions window shows a list of similar questions which would result in a similar answer. To the left, the score for the currently selected answer is displayed. The knowledge base user can also search the knowledge base for another answer, edit the current answer, or add a new answer. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.3 | The **Knowledge Base Training** tool opens. Type the following: **I have a policy issue with my current provider**. Press **enter**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Chatbot5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.4 | The maximum score is 1000.

As an alternative to the web form that collects the customer’s quoting data, Future Corp’s intelligent RPA chatbot provides an interactive virtual agent.<br/><br/>The chatbot can understand and respond to customer inquiries. For example, a chatbot recognizes that phrases like “I would like to switch my insurance policy” and “I need insurance” both lead to initiating the quoting process. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | Select the **Insurance Ingrid** script (1) and click **Start** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | After the chatbot launches, resize the chatbot by mousing over the bottom right corner and dragging the corner of the chatbot window to make it larger. <br/><br/> Otherwise, the insurance options will not display well. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/chatbot-resize.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Type the following: **I need insurance.**  <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | The chatbot engages the customer to collect all the information needed to provide a quote. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.4 | Select the **Car** insurance. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.5 | Enter **Lexus**,**RX350**,**2021**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.6 | Enter the vehicle identification number (VIN), which typically consists of 12 characters (for example, enter **123456789012**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.7 | Enter the following: **My email is mary@email.com**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot6.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.8 | Enter the following: **Mary, Johnson**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot7.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.9 | Enter an address such as **1 Main Street, Austin, TX 78730**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot8.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.10 | Enter **yes** for a quick quote. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot9.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | Now that all the information has been collected, the chatbot will invoke the quoting bot to generate the quote. The quote bot will enter all the customer information and retrieve the calculated quote amount. We see the quote amount in the chat response. The quoting bot will also initate the New Insurance Quote process. In this case the quote will be emailed to the customer and the process will wait for the customer’s response. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.11 | Enter **yes** for a follow-up contact. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot10.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.12 | Enter **no** for anything else. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-chatbot11.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.4** | **View the quote status** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Let's look in the workflow to see the process the bot initiated. We do that from the Process Portal. When we open the Quote Status dashboard, we see the new quote for Mary at the top of the list. Workflow will continue to manage the quote process. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.1 | From **Chrome**, open the **Process Portal**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Quote-status1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.2 | Log in as **customerService / password**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Quote-status2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.3 | Under **Dashboards**, click **Show more…**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Quote-status3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.4 | Click to open the **Quote Status** dashboard. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Quote-status4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nUsing the Cloud Pak for Business Automation, Future Corp had everything they needed to extend their automation with RPA. They used a low-code bot authoring environment to create bots and chatbots to improve their policy quoting process.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe enhanced solution continues to use workflow to manage and monitor the end-to-end quoting process while using RPA to automate manual tasks and to engage directly with customers using intelligent chatbots. This combines the ability of workflow and the abilities of RPA.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
