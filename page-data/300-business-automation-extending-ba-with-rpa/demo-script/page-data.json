We’ll take advantage of the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation’s capabilities to add robotic process automation (RPA) to a quoting process that is already automated with workflow.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n<br/>\n(Printer-ready PDF of demo script <a href=\"./300-BA-extending-with-rpa-Demo-Script.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\n<br/>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Existing quoting process - without RPA</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Introduce the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Future Corp is a traditional auto insurance provider that has a goal of improving customer experience by making it easier to provide new insurance policy quotes to its customers. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the company currently creates insurance quotes. In the existing process, every request for a new insurance policy must be routed to a policy specialist. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Future Corp’s current quoting process (without RPA) in Process Designer, which you opened during the demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-without-RPA.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | We are looking at the process diagram for Future Corp’s quoting process. Process diagrams are created in Process Designer. Process Designer is used to design and implement the quoting process. Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each new quote. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Execute the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is used by customer service agents to launch new quote requests and work on assigned tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Go to the **Process Portal** tab, which you opened during the demo preparation. Log in as **customerService** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is highly customizable to fit your organization’s look and feel. The responsive user interface provides flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a customer site. It can be tailored though a set of configuration options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/><br/>To request a quote, a customer service representative initiates a new quote request and enters the customer’s policy data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Under **Launch**, click **New Insurance Quote** to start a new quote. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Use the **Get Test Data** button to pre-fill in the form with some test data. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.4 | **Optionally**, change the customer name and the make of the car to make this request unique. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Click **Get Quote** to close the task and submit the new quote request. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | Policy specialists enter the customer data into the policy system and create the quote. They use the Process Portal to organize their tasks and work on the tasks assigned to them. Our specialist has received a new task to prepare the quote.<br/><br/>When the policy specialist receives the quote request, she needs to log into the quoting system to prepare a new quote, which involves manually entering a significant amount of information. This is both time consuming and error prone as the specialist must go field-by-field in order to move all the customer’s data into the quoting system. <br/><br/>Behind the scenes, the quoting process is managed by workflow. Once the policy specialist completes this task, the system waits for the customer’s response. If the customer accepts the quote, the policy specialist will again log into the quoting system to establish a new insurance policy for the customer. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.6 | (Still on the Process Portal) Log out (as **customerService**), and then log in as **policy1** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA6.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.7 | Run the newest **Prepare New Quote** task by clicking the task name. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA7.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.8 | Open the legacy quoting app by using the shortcut in the bottom right of the taskbar to click **FCQS_2021.jar**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA8.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.9 | Log in to the quoting app (any username and password will work). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA9.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.10 | Show the task UI and the quoting app to make the point that the quote data must be manually entered into the quoting app. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA10.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Adding an RPA bot to the workflow</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Introduce the workflow process with RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now let’s look at how we can incorporate RPA to reduce that manual work. Here is a new version of the quoting workflow. The workflow is the same except we’ve modified the middle swim lane. Instead of assigning the tasks to a policy specialist, we route them directly to a bot for immediate execution. Just as with the original workflow, when there is a quoting exception, the quote request is routed to a policy specialist for resolution. For example, certain car models such as Audi and BMW require manual review to generate a quote. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Open the process diagram for the quoting process with RPA in Process Designer. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | You will see the following process diagram. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Bot authoring: Launch the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s RPA capabilities, Future Corp was able to easily build and deploy software robots, or bots, that automatically enter customer data into the quoting system. This enabled Future Corp to automate repetitive tasks such as creating customer quotes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Go to **RPA Studio**, which you opened during preparation, with the **Get Quote.wal** file opened to the **GetQuote** routine. |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s low code bot authoring environment, Future Corp easily built and tested their bots. Hundreds of pre-built commands are available to assemble bots using intuitive wizards.<br/><br/>Without RPA, policy specialists would had to manually copy and paste customer data into the quoting system. With RPA, Future Corp created a bot to connect to the quoting system, fill in the extracted information and email the quote to the customer once it is available. <br/><br/>Here we see some of the bot commands they used. First, the quoting application is opened. Next, the username and password are entered. Commands were used to open the quoting application, enter user name and password, and generate a new quote.<br/><br/>Now let’s see how to build the quote bot from scratch. First, we’ll use the Launch and Attach Window command to open the quoting application.<br/><br/><InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The following build from scratch steps are simple, but intricate. Be sure to practice these steps so you can master your demo delivery.</InlineNotification> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.2 | To start creating a new bot, click **New**, select **Wal File**, and then click **Open**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.3 | In the Toolbox search bar, type **attach** and find the **Launch and Attach Window** command. Drag it out to the script window. Set the executable parameter to the **FCQS_2021.jar** file (located in c:\\Future Corp), and click **Save**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | RPA Studio allows you to immediately run the bot commands. The debugging mode enables you to control the bot's operation, test commands, track variables, and debug scripts on remote computers. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.4 | In the toolbar ribbon, click **Start** to run the bot. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.5 | The **Focus Corp Quoting System** will appear. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.3** | **Bot authoring: Log in to the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The recorder assists in creating your script. With the recorder, you can select user interface components to enter commands in your script. Let’s build the commands to log into the quoting application. First, we'll record the user name field. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1 | In the toolbar ribbon, click **Start Recorder** to capture keystrokes from the quoting app. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/New-Bot5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.2 | Hold the **control** key and mouse over the **User Name** field in the quoting app. Release the control key once the field highlights in red.

We’ll take advantage of the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation’s capabilities to add robotic process automation (RPA) to a quoting process that is already automated with workflow.\n\n<br/>\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n<br/>\n(Printer-ready PDF of demo script <a href=\"./300-BA-extending-with-rpa-Demo-Script.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\n<br/>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Existing quoting process - without RPA</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Introduce the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Future Corp is a traditional auto insurance provider that has a goal of improving customer experience by making it easier to provide new insurance policy quotes to its customers. <br/><br/> Let’s look at how the company currently creates insurance quotes. In the existing process, every request for a new insurance policy must be routed to a policy specialist. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Future Corp’s current quoting process (without RPA) in Process Designer, which you opened during the demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-without-RPA.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | We are looking at the process diagram for Future Corp’s quoting process. Process diagrams are created in Process Designer. Process Designer is used to design and implement the quoting process. Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each new quote. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Execute the quoting process workflow without RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is used by customer service agents to launch new quote requests and work on assigned tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Go to the **Process Portal** tab, which you opened during the demo preparation. Log in as **customerService** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/> |\n| **Narration** | The Process Portal is highly customizable to fit your organization’s look and feel. The responsive user interface provides flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a customer site. It can be tailored though a set of configuration options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/><br/>To request a quote, a customer service representative initiates a new quote request and enters the customer’s policy data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Under **Launch**, click **New Insurance Quote** to start a new quote. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Use the **Get Test Data** button to pre-fill in the form with some test data. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA3.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.4 | **Optionally**, change the customer name and the make of the car to make this request unique. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA4.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.5 | Click **Get Quote** to close the task and submit the new quote request. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA5.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Narration** | Policy specialists enter the customer data into the policy system and create the quote. They use the Process Portal to organize their tasks and work on the tasks assigned to them. Our specialist has received a new task to prepare the quote.<br/><br/>When the policy specialist receives the quote request, she needs to log into the quoting system to prepare a new quote, which involves manually entering a significant amount of information. This is both time consuming and error prone as the specialist must go field-by-field in order to move all the customer’s data into the quoting system. <br/><br/>Behind the scenes, the quoting process is managed by workflow. Once the policy specialist completes this task, the system waits for the customer’s response. If the customer accepts the quote, the policy specialist will again log into the quoting system to establish a new insurance policy for the customer. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.6 | (Still on the Process Portal) Log out (as **customerService**), and then log in as **policy1** (password is **password**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA6.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.7 | Run the newest **Prepare New Quote** task by clicking the task name. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA7.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.8 | Open the legacy quoting app by using the shortcut in the bottom right of the taskbar to click **FCQS_2021.jar**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA8.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.9 | Log in to the quoting app (any username and password will work). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA9.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.10 | Show the task UI and the quoting app to make the point that the quote data must be manually entered into the quoting app. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Run-Process-without-RPA10.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Adding an RPA bot to the workflow</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Introduce the workflow process with RPA** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now let’s look at how we can incorporate RPA to reduce that manual work. Here is a new version of the quoting workflow. The workflow is the same except we’ve modified the middle swim lane. Instead of assigning the tasks to a policy specialist, we route them directly to a bot for immediate execution. Just as with the original workflow, when there is a quoting exception, the quote request is routed to a policy specialist for resolution. For example, certain car models such as Audi and BMW require manual review to generate a quote. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Open the process diagram for the quoting process with RPA in Process Designer. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA1.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | You will see the following process diagram. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/images/Process-with-RPA2.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Bot authoring: Launch the quoting app** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s RPA capabilities, Future Corp was able to easily build and deploy software robots, or bots, that automatically enter customer data into the quoting system. This enabled Future Corp to automate repetitive tasks such as creating customer quotes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Go to **RPA Studio**, which you opened during preparation, with the **Get Quote.wal** file opened to the **GetQuote** routine. |\n| **Narration** | Using the Pak’s low code bot authoring environment, Future Corp easily built and tested their bots. Hundreds of pre-built commands are available to assemble bots using intuitive wizards.<br/><br/>Without RPA, policy specialists would had to manually copy and paste customer data into the quoting system. With RPA, Future Corp created a bot to connect to the quoting system, fill in the extracted information and email the quote to the customer once it is available. <br/><br/>Here we see some of the bot commands they used. First, the quoting application is opened. Next, the username and password are entered. Commands were used to open the quoting application, enter user name and password, and generate a new quote.<br/><br/>Now let’s see how to build the quote bot from scratch. First, we’ll use the Launch and Attach Window command to open the quoting application.<br/><br/><InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: The following build from scratch steps are simple, but intricate.

They used a low-code bot authoring environment to create bots and chatbots to improve their policy quoting process.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe enhanced solution continues to use workflow to manage and monitor the end-to-end quoting process while using RPA to automate manual tasks and to engage directly with customers using intelligent chatbots. This combines the ability of workflow and the abilities of RPA.\n\n<br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-business-automation-extending-ba-with-rpa/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
