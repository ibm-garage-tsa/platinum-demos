RPA Client VM <br/>\n2. Business Automation Workflow (BAW) VM\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - RPA Server</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn addition to the Technology Zone provided environment, you will need access to an IBM RPA SaaS environment. <br/><br/>\n\nFor **IBMers**, refer to the RPA contact person to establish your RPA account in the cloud tenant. <br/><br/>\n•\tContact your IBM RPA TechSales Geo Lead (refer to the table below) for access to your IBM local IBM RPA tenant <br/>\n•\tOnce onboarded, you will receive an email with account details and link to complete the onboarding\n\n<br/>\n\n| Region | Contact Person | Email |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Business Partners | Burt Hughes | buhughes@us.ibm.com |\n| Americas | Zach Silverstein | zachary.silverstein@ibm.com |\n| EMEA | Jukka Juselius | jukka.juselius@fi.ibm.com |\n| AP | Jenny Khuc Mai Thuong | khuc@sg.ibm.com |\n\n<br/>\n\nFor **Business Partners**, request your own RPA Server SaaS tenant for your organization. To submit a request for an IBM server SaaS tenant, provide the following: <br/><br/>\n• Company Name and CEID (which can be found in your PartnerWorld profile) <br/>\n• Full Name (first and last) of the individual who will be set up as administrator of the account <br/>\n• Company email address of the individual listed above (non-company email addresses will be rejected) <br/>\n• Data Center choice (choose one: Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Singapore, Sao Paulo) <br/>\n• Use the following subject line: **RPA BP Tenant Access Request** <br/>\n• Send an email to Burt Hughes (buhughes@us.ibm.com)\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - RPA Studio</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nInstall RPA Studio on the RPA Client VM <br/><br/>\n\n1. **You must change the computer name in your RPA VM to be unique** in order to connect to your RPA SaaS tenant. In Windows, set your computer name to be unique (for example, by changing the computer name to be your initials plus your postal code).<br/><br/>\na. Access your Technology Zone environment using the link in the reservation email. You may also use the IBM Technology Zone’s My Library -> My Reservations page. <br/><br/>\nb.
