The application in this demo is called Stan’s Robot Shop, and it uses various technologies such as Java, Python, and MySQL. |\n| **Demo products** | Instana |\n| **Demo capabilities** | Dependency mapping; Intelligent alerting; Distributed tracing |\n| **Sales guidance** | Download the sales guidance document <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/lf8cn8qe9h6dexpn66vo5s8rt2pp0aka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. |\n| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/hdarww1v4mlgf8r1abxrt3a6zps8h92m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is a short deck of customer-facing slides that sets the context for the demo. |\n| **Demo script** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/ovlk0ek2vi4w75ca4tdomb3cprsm9w59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see. <br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |\n| **Demo guidance** | The demo environment is set to automatically inject an error into the application once every hour. <br/> <br/> The cycle begins on the half-hour (so 9:30, 10:30, etc). You should see errors begin to show up a few minutes after this (around 32 or 33 minutes past the hour). <br/> <br/> The error will resolve itself and go back to a normal state after about 10 minutes. <br/> <br/> There are two options for how to give demos, given how this demo environment functions: <br/><br/> 1. Schedule a meeting so that you can begin a live demo at 30 minutes past the hour. This will allow you to show the active incident in real time. <br/> 2. Run through the demo flow using a past incident. You can set the time period to when an incident was active (instructions are in the demo script). You will be able to run through the same scenario, except it will not show the incident alerts on the events icon on the sidebar. |\n| **Customer-ready <br/> demo video** | View the demo video <a href=\"https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/eogn2t43x23nk8ksyk236teqppe5d49e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is a short, but detailed, hands-on walkthrough of the scenario. The video is customer-ready. <br/> <br/> Potential uses of this video are: <br/><br/> 1. Familiarize yourself with the details of this scenario <br/> 2. Gain customer agreement that they would like to have a tech-seller do a deep-dive demo of this scenario <br/> 3.
