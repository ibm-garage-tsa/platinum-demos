The application in this demo is called Stan’s Robot Shop, and it uses various technologies such as Java, Python, and MySQL. |\n| **Demo products** | Instana |\n| **Demo capabilities** | Dependency mapping; Intelligent alerting; Distributed tracing |\n| **Demo script** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href=\"./100-Observability-Demo-Script.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see. <br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |\n| **Demo guidance** | The demo environment is set to automatically inject an error into the application once every hour. <br/> <br/> The cycle begins on the half-hour (so 9:30, 10:30, etc). You should see errors begin to show up a few minutes after this (around 32 or 33 minutes past the hour). <br/> <br/> The error will resolve itself and go back to a normal state after about 10 minutes. <br/> <br/> You can set the timeframe so that you can demo the active incident, even if your timing does not coincide with when the error cycle starts. See instructions below (under **1 - Environment setup**). |\n| **Customer-ready <br/> demo video** | View the demo video <a href=\"https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/eogn2t43x23nk8ksyk236teqppe5d49e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is a short, but detailed, hands-on walkthrough of the scenario. The video is customer-ready. <br/> <br/> Potential uses of this video are: <br/><br/> 1. Familiarize yourself with the details of this scenario <br/> 2. Gain customer agreement that they would like to have a tech-seller do a deep-dive demo of this scenario <br/> 3. Use as a prospecting tool to generate customer interest in applying these capabilities |\n| **Required version** | Instana 3.213 |\n| **How to get support** | Contact <a href=\"https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0124J683GW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#itz-techzone-support</a> or <a href=\"mailto:techzone.help@ibm.com\">techzone.help@ibm.com</a> regarding issues with reserving and provisioning TechZone environments. <br/><br/> Contact <a href=\"https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0216F39ACU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#platinumdemos-automation-support</a> regarding issues with setting up and running this demo use case. |\n\n**PREPARE TO GIVE THE DEMO**\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Environment setup</summary>\n<br/>\n\nLog into the demo environment: <br/><br/>\n•\tFor IBMers, click <a href=\"https://ibmdemo-instanaibm.instana.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. <br/>\n•\tFor business partners, click <a href=\"https://demo-partner.instana.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. <br/>\n•\tIf it is your first time accessing the environment, you will need to request access (See **2 - Requisition instructions** below).
