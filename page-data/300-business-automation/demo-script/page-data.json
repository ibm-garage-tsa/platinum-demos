Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each refund request. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. <br/> <br/> Looking at Focus Corp’s refund request process, customers can initiate returns directly from the company’s portal. Currently, each request is routed to a customer service agent for resolution. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Focus Corp’s **Request Refund without STP** (straight-through processing) in Process Designer, which you opened during your demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation/images/Step_1_final_screen.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/><br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Executing the workflow without straight-through processing (SaaS)</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Task management and execution (SaaS)** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n|  | <InlineNotification><br/><strong>NOTE</strong>: This section is for <strong>SaaS only</strong>.

It can be configured through a set of options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/> <br/> Process Portal has a robust search capability. You can create a customized task list, for example, with specific business data, by saving task-based searches for later use. <br/> <br/> Customer service agents use the task list to organize and work on the tasks assigned to them.

Dashboards can be designed and shared in minutes that provide insight into important business activities and processes. You can prepare, design, and track visualizations of metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other measurements of business performance in customizable dashboards. <br/> <br/> Additionally, the historical data can be used to feed a data lake to apply machine learning to your automations. For example, to make even more sophisticated refund decisions, we could use a data lake to incorporate machine learning into our refund process. The Cloud Pak for Business Automation includes some machine learning samples to help you get started. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>6 - Modeling decisions</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **6.1** | **Review the refund approval decision model** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Let’s look at how the business analyst can create and manage business rules to further increase straight-through processing.

Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each refund request. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. <br/> <br/> Looking at Focus Corp’s refund request process, customers can initiate returns directly from the company’s portal. Currently, each request is routed to a customer service agent for resolution. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Focus Corp’s **Request Refund without STP** (straight-through processing) in Process Designer, which you opened during your demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation/images/Step_1_final_screen.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/><br/> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Executing the workflow without straight-through processing (SaaS)</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Task management and execution (SaaS)** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n|  | <InlineNotification><br/><strong>NOTE</strong>: This section is for <strong>SaaS only</strong>.

Dashboards can be designed and shared in minutes that provide insight into important business activities and processes. You can prepare, design, and track visualizations of metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other measurements of business performance in customizable dashboards. <br/> <br/> Additionally, the historical data can be used to feed a data lake to apply machine learning to your automations. For example, to make even more sophisticated refund decisions, we could use a data lake to incorporate machine learning into our refund process.
