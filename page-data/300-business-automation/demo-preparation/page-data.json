Business Partners and IBMers can deploy the solution into a ROKS environment. At the current time, the SaaS environment is restricted for privacy and confidentiality reasons to employees of IBM.\r\n\r\nSelect a demo environment option:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Option 1 - SaaS: Gain access to a SaaS environment</summary>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nThis demo runs on the Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service demo environment. If you are a seller or technical seller needing access to an environment, please locate and contact your local market admin directly using the list <a href=\"http://ibm.biz/NextGenTenantAdmins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nOnce your environment is ready, continue to **Prepare to give the demo**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Option 2 - Self-install: Install on a TechZone cluster</summary>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**1 - Reserve an environment on TechZone**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **1.1** | **Reserve your OpenShift cluster** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | a. To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.2-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/615dcbbc7ed3c6001edaa865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and complete the form<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. You will need your own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces. <br/><br/>**Suggestion**: When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location<br/><br/>b.\tSubmit and wait for your cluster to be ready<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, try a second time. If it fails again, wait 30 minutes and check <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reservations</a> to see if the reservation was successful before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com.<br/><br/>Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below |\r\n\r\n| **1.2** | **Validate your cluster** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | While you may see your environment through the console within a few minutes, the operator will typically take 2 to 5 hours to complete the installation of the Cloud Pak for Business automation<br/><br/>**Cluster readiness expectations**: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours<br/><br/>To know when your cluster is ready: (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the <a href=\"https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Troubleshooting page)</a><br/><br/>a. First, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console. You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>c. On the IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists<br/><br/>d.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right<br/><br/>e. The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info, which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.  The icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map provides all the required urls and login information needed to install and run the demonstration. <br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required. |\r\n\r\n| **1.3** | **Set up ROKS ingress** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | OpenShift environments based on the demo pattern and running on IBM Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) will not have any trusted ingress or certificates for Cloud Pak for Business Automation routes and services. This means that workflows (such as those running in Workflow Authoring in Business Automation Studio) will not be able to successfully connect to ODM services. <br/><br/> The following is needed to ensure the ODM are trusted by browsers and by Workflow Authoring. (Additional networking configurations may also be supported but have not been tested.) The following steps require the OpenShift command-line interface (the oc command) and cannot be done in the web console. <br/><br/> Go <a href=\"https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> to install the OpenShift command-line interface before continuing<br/><br/>a. Open the OpenShift web console using the button in the upper right of your ROKS cluster page in IBM Cloud console<br/><br/>b. Navigate to Home -> Projects -> openshift-ingress<br/><br/>c. Navigate to Workloads -> Secrets and locate the secret with the name equal to your cluster hostname (such as `dteroks-0600004t7y-ycnqs-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` or `ibmcloud-roks-83eow-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000`)<br/><br/>d. Extract/copy tls.key and save to a new file using a text editor without any special formatting (be careful not to type any other character in the file)<br/><br/>e. Repeat for tls.crt in a second new file<br/><br/>f. Access the CLI at the upper right of the web console by clicking **IBM# -> Copy Login Command**<br/><br/>g. Click **Display token** and copy the line under **Log in with this token**<br/><br/>h. Paste it into a MacOS or Linux capable terminal where the CLI is installed and execute<br/><br/>i. Run the following command: `oc project dtecp4ba` (or the name of your own project/namespace)<br/><br/>j. Run the following command where `tls.crt` and `tls.key` are the names of the files you created above: `oc create secret tls cp4a-wildcard --cert tls.crt --key tls.key`<br/><br/>k. Back in the OpenShift web console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators -> IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation -> CP4BA Deployment tab -> `icp4adeploy` -> YAML tab (or if not using OLM, Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions -> ICP4ACluster -> Instances tab -> icp4adeploy -> YAML tab)<br/><br/>l. Carefully search for the `shared_configuration` section<br/><br/>m. Carefully add a new line below `shared_configuration` and indent two spaces<br/><br/>n. Carefully enter the following: `external_tls_certificate_secret: cp4a-wildcard`<br/><br/>0. Click **Save**<br/><br/>p. Wait for the operator to reconcile the CR which normally requires 30-120 mins<br/><br/>q. Verify the configuration is effective by navigating to an ODM route in a new browser tab (such as `https://odm-decisionserverconsole-<namespace>.<cluster>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`) and ensure it shows as secure with a trusted certificate (most browsers show a lock icon to the left of the URL) |\r\n\r\n| **1.4** | **Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors |\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**2 - Install the Straight-through Processing demo**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **2.1** | **Deploy Operational Decision Manager artifacts** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | a.

To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.2-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/615dcbbc7ed3c6001edaa865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and complete the form<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. You will need your own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces. <br/><br/>**Suggestion**: When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location<br/><br/>b.\tSubmit and wait for your cluster to be ready<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, try a second time. If it fails again, wait 30 minutes and check <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reservations</a> to see if the reservation was successful before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com.<br/><br/>Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below |\r\n\r\n| **1.2** | **Validate your cluster** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | While you may see your environment through the console within a few minutes, the operator will typically take 2 to 5 hours to complete the installation of the Cloud Pak for Business automation<br/><br/>**Cluster readiness expectations**: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours<br/><br/>To know when your cluster is ready: (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the <a href=\"https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Troubleshooting page)</a><br/><br/>a. First, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console. You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>c. On the IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists<br/><br/>d.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right<br/><br/>e. The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info, which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.  The icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map provides all the required urls and login information needed to install and run the demonstration. <br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required. |\r\n\r\n| **1.3** | **Set up ROKS ingress** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | OpenShift environments based on the demo pattern and running on IBM Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) will not have any trusted ingress or certificates for Cloud Pak for Business Automation routes and services. This means that workflows (such as those running in Workflow Authoring in Business Automation Studio) will not be able to successfully connect to ODM services. <br/><br/> The following is needed to ensure the ODM are trusted by browsers and by Workflow Authoring. (Additional networking configurations may also be supported but have not been tested.) The following steps require the OpenShift command-line interface (the oc command) and cannot be done in the web console. <br/><br/> Go <a href=\"https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> to install the OpenShift command-line interface before continuing<br/><br/>a. Open the OpenShift web console using the button in the upper right of your ROKS cluster page in IBM Cloud console<br/><br/>b. Navigate to Home -> Projects -> openshift-ingress<br/><br/>c. Navigate to Workloads -> Secrets and locate the secret with the name equal to your cluster hostname (such as `dteroks-0600004t7y-ycnqs-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` or `ibmcloud-roks-83eow-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000`)<br/><br/>d. Extract/copy tls.key and save to a new file using a text editor without any special formatting (be careful not to type any other character in the file)<br/><br/>e. Repeat for tls.crt in a second new file<br/><br/>f. Access the CLI at the upper right of the web console by clicking **IBM# -> Copy Login Command**<br/><br/>g. Click **Display token** and copy the line under **Log in with this token**<br/><br/>h. Paste it into a MacOS or Linux capable terminal where the CLI is installed and execute<br/><br/>i. Run the following command: `oc project dtecp4ba` (or the name of your own project/namespace)<br/><br/>j. Run the following command where `tls.crt` and `tls.key` are the names of the files you created above: `oc create secret tls cp4a-wildcard --cert tls.crt --key tls.key`<br/><br/>k. Back in the OpenShift web console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators -> IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation -> CP4BA Deployment tab -> `icp4adeploy` -> YAML tab (or if not using OLM, Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions -> ICP4ACluster -> Instances tab -> icp4adeploy -> YAML tab)<br/><br/>l. Carefully search for the `shared_configuration` section<br/><br/>m. Carefully add a new line below `shared_configuration` and indent two spaces<br/><br/>n. Carefully enter the following: `external_tls_certificate_secret: cp4a-wildcard`<br/><br/>0. Click **Save**<br/><br/>p. Wait for the operator to reconcile the CR which normally requires 30-120 mins<br/><br/>q. Verify the configuration is effective by navigating to an ODM route in a new browser tab (such as `https://odm-decisionserverconsole-<namespace>.<cluster>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`) and ensure it shows as secure with a trusted certificate (most browsers show a lock icon to the left of the URL) |\r\n\r\n| **1.4** | **Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors |\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**2 - Install the Straight-through Processing demo**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **2.1** | **Deploy Operational Decision Manager artifacts** |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Actions** | a.
