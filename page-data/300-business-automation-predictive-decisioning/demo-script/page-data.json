You will learn how to integrate Watson Studio Machine Learning with the Cloud Pak to create prediction services. These predictions are then used by automated decision services to target retention policies, lower customer retention costs, and eliminate many paper-based processes.<br/><br/>\n\nWe will see how business users can quickly get started creating and using predictions to improve their everyday processes. Data scientists will also learn ways to speed experimentation in AI development.<br/><br/>\n\nLet’s get started!<br/><br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Reviewing the manual call center process </summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Show SkyTalk’s current manual process** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | SkyTalk is a telecommunications provider losing many of its best customers to competitors. SkyTalk needs to reduce customer churn. Let’s review the set of written customer retention policy guidelines department management implemented. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1** | Show SkyTalk’s **Retention offer document** opened during demo preparation. Discuss the problems caused by the current manual process. <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Call-center agents were asked to understand various retention offers and pick the ‘best’ option to retain the client. There were several problems with this approach.  did not work well because of the variety of reasons. <br/><br/>Agent could not factor in unique customer circumstances, and thus offers were not tailored. SkyTalk’s retention policy guidelines were implemented inconsistently by call center agents. Agents also needed to make real-time decisions while on the phone with the customer, adding time pressure. <br/><br/>The results were skyrocketing customer retention costs, while attrition remained steady.<br/><br/>SkyTalk needed is a reliable way to find the lowest cost retention offers that customer at risk of leaving would accept. SkyTalk decided to invest in an automated predictive solution.<br/><br/>This new application will leverage decision automation and machine learning to provide agents customer-specific retention offers in real-time. Machine learning will be used to analyze a customer profile to guide the decision automation in the retention offer selection. Let’s start and see how to automate the retention offer determination using business rules. |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Modeling the business rules </summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Review the components of SkyTalk’s retention decisions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | A business analyst in the customer care division uses machine learning and decision automation technologies to configure the retention offer application. <br/><br/>The business analyst writes a set of business rules to generate retention offer recommendations. This set of rules is called a decision service and is shown on a decision model diagram. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Access the Business Automation Studio on the IBM Automation home page window opened during demo preparation.

Each blue box represents a sub decision. The green shapes represent the input data. <br/><br/>The ‘Determine retention offer’ decision service requires two inputs: ‘Ranked retention offers’ and ‘Retention budget’ sub decisions that both use predictions.<br/><br/>The ‘Ranked retention offers’ sub decision establishes a list of eligible offers for individual customers and calculates the cost of retention.<br/><br/>The ‘Retention budget’ sub decision calculates SkyTalk’s maximum cost that should be spent to keep the customer. The retention budget is calculated using predictions for a customer’s lifetime value and propensity to churn. <br/><br/>The ‘Ranked retention offers’ top-level decision cycles through the list of eligible offers and selects the least expensive one that does not exceed the calculated retention budget for the given customer.<br/><br/>Now the business analyst uses IBM Watson Studio to create the two predictions required by the ‘Retention budget’ sub decision. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Review the **Retention offer decision model** after it opens.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image73.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Creating the predictive models </summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Show data sources used for prediction** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The business analyst started a project to create machine learning models and deploy them for use in SkyTalk’s execution environment. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click **SkyTalk customer retention project** in the Watson Studio project window opened during demo preparation.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image2.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click the **Assets** tab. |\n| **Narration** | Five years of data from SkyTalk’s existing customer database has been loaded into IBM Watson Studio.

Productivity and compliance are increased thanks to automation, costs are better allocated, and customer satisfaction can be increased.<br/><br/>\n\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.<br/><br/>\n\n**Note: At the end of the demonstration**<br/><br/>\n\nTo be able to follow the same scenario in your next demo, it is important to restore the demo to its initial state:<br/><br/>\n\n1.\tUn-deploy your ML service in your Watson Studio deployment environment to not be charged any more.<br/>\n\n2.\tReturn in the SkyTalk initial retention DS and remove:<br/>\n- The Customer Churn predictive model<br/>\n- The Customer Lifetime Value predictive model<br/>\n- The 2 predictions nodes in the \"Retention Offer\" decision model<br/>\n\n3.\tRemove the churn experiment in Watson Studio you have created if you have performed the experiment creation phase.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>(Optional) 3 - Advanced extended scenario</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Creating a predictive model from a data file** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Note** | Depending on your demo objectives, you can just show the end resulting churn prediction and move on (3.1.6). This section shows how the business analyst creates a Watson ML Machine learning service. This is good material if you have the time and/or the audience is technical. It will take around 2-3 minutes to create the 8 pipelines for each prediction models. |\n| **Narration** | The business analyst starts an AutoAI experiment in Watson Studio to create a new Churn prediction, referred to as a pipeline. The AutoAI tool in Watson Studio automatically analyzes real data and generates candidate model pipelines, ranking them according to the project’s objective.<br/><br/>The experiment can then train, improve, and test the candidate pipelines on real data subsets. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **New AutoAI experiment**.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image3.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | **Name** the experiment \"Churn prediction 2” (1) and click **Create** (2).<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image8.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Now the analyst selects the customer loyalty data file and specifies the goal, predicting the likelihood a given customer is going to leave SkyTalk. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | Click **Select from project**.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image136.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | Select the Click “**Data asset**”(1) and then select **SkyTalk customer loyalty data.xsv** file (2). <br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image9.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | During the experiment the model automatically selects and tests various algorithms. The experiment produces a set of pipelines the business analyst reviews. Then the algorithm that best fits the project’s prediction quality criteria is selected. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Click **Select asset** (1) and select the **CHURN** (2) column as the attribute to predict.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image10.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.10 | Click **Run experiment**.<br/><br/>**Note:** Make sure to wait until the computation is done.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image89.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Watson studio automatically suggests eight different models for the business analyst to choose from to create his prediction model.<br/><br/>**NOTE**: After two minutes your eight pipelines should be ready to explore. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.11 | Return to step **3.1.7** in the main scenario script. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
