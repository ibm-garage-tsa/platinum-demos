Go in the **Assets** tab\n![](./images/image50.png) <br/>\n29. Your two machine learning services are now ready to be deployed\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Deploy your ML models</summary>\n<br/>\n\nYour ML services will be accessible to other applications once deployed. <br/>\nNOTE: Your free quota will be consumed as soon as the service will de deployed. Don't forget to remove the deployments as soon as you are done with your demonstration. Follow the **Un-deploy your ML models** step to un-deploy the services and to stop the billing process.\n\n1. From your Watson Studio environment, go in your deployment space\n2. In the **Asset** tab, deploy the two assets by clicking on the rocket button\n![](./images/image51.png) <br/>\n3. Select **Online** and name your deployment **Churn** (Resp **Lifetime value**) for the two deployments. Click on **Create** for each of them.\n![](./images/image54.png) <br/>\n![](./images/image55.png) <br/>\n4. Click on the **Deployment** tab. Your two services should be deployed.\n![](./images/image56.png) <br/>\nNOTE: You are now charged until you remove the deployments from that table by selecting **Delete** on the right hand side of the row. This is the un-deploy phase which you will have to perform after each demo.\n![](./images/image57.png) <br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Get the credentials to set up the ML provider</summary>\n<br/>\n\nThis section explains how to get the various elements needed to set up the machine learning provider in ADS.\n\n1.
