This scenario is not willing to explain in detail what rules are, and it is not in the scope of the scenario to go deep inside Automation Decision Services's rule management capabilities. The focus of the demo is really around the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) native integration. It is also in the scope of this demo to show the power of Cloud Pak for Business Automation to create low-code interfaces from where Automation Decision Services will be consumed and valorized. <br/><br/> This demo is 100% based on IBM technology: <br/> 1.\tWatson Machine Learning <br/> 2.\tCloud Pak for Business Automation |\n| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1, Cloud Pak for Data and AI |\n| **Demo capabilities** | Business Rule Automation, Predictive Services Integration, Rapid Application Development |\n| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see (**Screenshots**). This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content.

Make sure that you have published your deployed decision service in Automation Decision Services. Refer to the deployment steps in [6 - Deploy and publish your decision service](#prep-6). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: I get an error when I launch the service after a reconnection.** <br/><br/>\n\nA: After reconfiguring your service connection, you may have some errors when you invoke your service during the preview. It may be due to some cash authorization access problems. It should work after you clean all of your browser's cache data (including cookies) and restart Application Designer. <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My decision service is deployed but with a different name.** <br/><br/>\n\nA: You will have to bind the decision node in Application Designer to your deployed service by following the steps below: <br/><br/>\n\n1. Click on **Open** in your application tile. <br/> <br/>\n\n2. Click on your user icon image, and open **Preferences**. <br/><br/>\n\n![Preferences](./images/7-4-Preferences_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n3. Select the **Advanced** view mode. Note: You may have to restart after this. <br/><br/>\n\n![Advanced](./images/7-4-Advanced_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n4. Click on the **Diagram** tab, in which you should see the application diagram. <br/><br/>\n\n![Diagram](./images/7-4-Diagram_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n5. Double-click on the **Call telco_retention_ds** box. <br/><br/>\n\n6. Select the **Implementation** tab. Click on **Select**, and select your own decision service. Make sure you also select the **retentionOffer** operation. <br/><br/>\n\n![Implementation](./images/7-4-Implementation_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n7. Go in the **Data Mapping** section, and make sure the local variables are linked to your service input/output. <br/><br/>\n\n![Data Mapping](./images/7-4-Data_Mapping_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n8. If you have errors, it may be due to the import that caused duplications (ex: CustomerRecord_1). You must then make sure that the variables are from that new class to allow the data mapping. <br/><br/>\n\n9. Click on the **Variables** tab, and select the customer (**CustomerRecord**). Select the duplicated type in the **Variable type** section. It should now be customer (CustomerRecord_1) type. <br/><br/>\n\n![Variable](./images/7-4-Variable_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n10. Repeat these steps for the subscription class. <br/><br/>\n\n11. Return to the **Diagram** view. <br/><br/>\n\n12. Reconnect your input and output data to map the new service type. You should now have no errors.

Make sure that you have published your deployed decision service in Automation Decision Services. Refer to the deployment steps in [6 - Deploy and publish your decision service](#prep-6). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: I get an error when I launch the service after a reconnection.** <br/><br/>\n\nA: After reconfiguring your service connection, you may have some errors when you invoke your service during the preview. It may be due to some cash authorization access problems. It should work after you clean all of your browser's cache data (including cookies) and restart Application Designer. <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My decision service is deployed but with a different name.** <br/><br/>\n\nA: You will have to bind the decision node in Application Designer to your deployed service by following the steps below: <br/><br/>\n\n1. Click on **Open** in your application tile. <br/> <br/>\n\n2. Click on your user icon image, and open **Preferences**. <br/><br/>\n\n![Preferences](./images/7-4-Preferences_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n3. Select the **Advanced** view mode. Note: You may have to restart after this. <br/><br/>\n\n![Advanced](./images/7-4-Advanced_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n4. Click on the **Diagram** tab, in which you should see the application diagram. <br/><br/>\n\n![Diagram](./images/7-4-Diagram_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n5. Double-click on the **Call telco_retention_ds** box. <br/><br/>\n\n6. Select the **Implementation** tab. Click on **Select**, and select your own decision service. Make sure you also select the **retentionOffer** operation. <br/><br/>\n\n![Implementation](./images/7-4-Implementation_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n7. Go in the **Data Mapping** section, and make sure the local variables are linked to your service input/output. <br/><br/>\n\n![Data Mapping](./images/7-4-Data_Mapping_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n8. If you have errors, it may be due to the import that caused duplications (ex: CustomerRecord_1). You must then make sure that the variables are from that new class to allow the data mapping. <br/><br/>\n\n9. Click on the **Variables** tab, and select the customer (**CustomerRecord**). Select the duplicated type in the **Variable type** section. It should now be customer (CustomerRecord_1) type. <br/><br/>\n\n![Variable](./images/7-4-Variable_600.png)\n<br/><br/>\n\n10. Repeat these steps for the subscription class. <br/><br/>\n\n11. Return to the **Diagram** view. <br/><br/>\n\n12. Reconnect your input and output data to map the new service type. You should now have no errors. Click on **Preview** and test the connection. <br/><br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n### 8 - Reset the demo for a new demo (15 minutes max)\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Redeploy your Watson Machine Learning services in IBM Watson Studio</summary>\n<br/>\n\n1.
