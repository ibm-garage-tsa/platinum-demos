In this section, you fork a github repository with all necessary assets for the demo, including the script to create the pipeline.\n\nOpen a browser and navigate to the URL below. \nhttps://github.com/IBM/cp4i-deployment-samples\n\n2. If necessary log in with your personal github account.\n\n3. Click Fork. \n\n\n4. Select the organization where you want to fork. \n\n\n5. Great, the cp4i-deployment-samples was forked to your organization. \n\n\n\nCloning the Github Repository to your machine\n\nNote: To copy the repo you will need to have the Git CLI in your machine. If you don’t have it, follow the installation steps described in this page, based in your operational system.\n\nOn the forked repo, click Code (1) and click on Copy URL button (2) on the Clone HTTPS section. \n\n2. Open your terminal window and execute the command below.\ngit clone <your_copied_repo_url.git>\n\n3. Open the cp4i-deployment-samples folder.\ncd cp4i-deployment-samples\n\n4. Here you should see multiple files and folder. To execute our script files, we need to change the file permission to be able to execute them.\nchmod 755 *\n\n\nAccessing your ROKS cluster and installing OC CLI\n\nIn this section, you access your ROKS cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.  If you already have the Command line tool, you are welcome to skip this section.\n\n1.Open My reservations page in IBM Technology Zone.\nhttps://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations\n\n2. Select your CP4I ROKS cluster.\n\n\n3. Click Open your Managed OpenShift (ROKS) environment button.\n\n\n4. Now click on OpenShift web console button.\n\n\n5.On Web console page, click ? button (1), and select Command line tools (2). \n\n\n6. Follow the links to install the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI) specific of your Operational System. \n\n\n\nAccessing your ROKS cluster using CLI\n\n1.Now let's log in OpenShift cluster using CLI. From the dropdown menu in the upper right of the page, where you see your username (1), click Copy Login Command (2).\n\n2. Click Display Token.\n\n3. Copy the Log in command.\n\n4.Open your terminal window and paste the log in command to access your OpenShift cluster.\n\n\n\nSetting up the parameters to install the pipeline\n\nWe’re now going to set up pipeline triggers. What we’re doing is linking your github repository to your OpenShift pipelines, so that when you commit a change to github, your OpenShift pipeline runs automatically.\n\n1. Let's set the namespace to be the correct namespace. It should be cp4i. On your terminal window, run the command below.\nexport NAMESPACE=cp4i\n\n2. We’ll set the github branch to main– don’t worry if you don’t understand this fully – it’s telling the script which version of the github artefacts to use.\nexport BRANCH=main\n\n3.We now need to set which github repository to use – it’s the URL of your forked repository that you made earlier - you’ are able to see it in your browser address bar too (check the image below).\n \n\n\nFor example ours is: https://github.com/rosorio/cp4i-deployment-samples.git. Note that rosorio is our github id – yours will be different.\n \nexport FORKED_REPO=https://github.com/<your_id>/cp4i-deployment-samples.git\n\n \n\nCreating the pipeline\n\nIn this section, you create the pipeline in OpenShift Pipeline page. \n\nBack to cp4i-deployment-samples folder, open DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators folder.\ncd DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators\n\n\n2. Now, you are ready to create the pipeline. Run the command below to do it.\n./cicd-apply-test-apic-pipeline.sh -n $NAMESPACE -r $FORKED_REPO -b $BRANCH\n\n\n\n3.You can check it's all there - go to OpenShift Console again, and on left menu, open Pipelines > Pipelines.\n\n\n4. On the Project combobox (1), select cp4i project (2).\n\n\n5.  Great, here you should see two pipelines. In the Demo Script, you will run the pipeline. \n\n\n\nDownload the BAR file\n\nIn this section, you download a BAR file to be used during the demo. \n\n1.On a Browser window, open the URL below.\nhttps://github.com/amarIBM/hello-world/blob/master/HttpEchoApp.bar\n\n2.Click Download button. \n\n\nGreat! Your are ready to demo. Now, it is time to learn how to deliver the demo, by exploring the Demo Script document.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1f588e3a2ffb591a22791e06bb9996ff","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":2123},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dent deletion 300-level live demo","description":"Dent deletion 300-level live demo","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Dent deletion\n  300-level live demo\ndescription: Dent deletion 300-level live demo\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Dent deletion <br/> 300-level live demo\n  </span> );\n\n![PENDING Dent Deletion banner](./images/TBD)\n\n<span id=\"top\"></span>\n\nTITLE: Automating deployment of multi-style integrations\nUse case: “Automating integration deployment using a cloud native approach, to achieve the benefits of greater productivity and simplified operations.”\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Introduction</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/dent-deletion-1-1-1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<span id=\"top\"></span>\n\n| DEMO OVERVIEW | |\n| :---         | :--- |\n| **Scenario overview** | This demo shows how the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation integrates machine learning to improve decisions.
