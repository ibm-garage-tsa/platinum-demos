We will use a customer account closing example to showcase how process mining helps an organization meet regulatory requirements while also reducing process execution cost. Let’s get started.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Visualizing the process</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Introduce the process challenges** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Focus Bank is a regional bank that is not meeting its regulatory requirements. The bank is required to complete all account closure requests within fourteen days. The bank knows it is not achieving this requirement, but is not sure why. Additionally, the bank performed over 60,000 account closures per year and suspects it could reduce process execution costs. However, it is unsure where to start. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Visualize the end-to-end process** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Analyzing processes in process mining starts with importing log files from the applications used in your business processes. Focus Bank’s account closing process uses a customer service system to take the customer’s request, a network access application to remove online access to the accounts and banking systems to liquidate and delete the account. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Click the **Datasource** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/datasource.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Log files are uploaded from the Datasource tab. Process mining accepts CSV or XES files as a data source. An API is available to programmatically upload log files. Once the file is uploaded, it is mapped to the relevant data columns. There are three mandatory columns: Process ID, Activity, and Time. Process ID can be anything that uniquely identifies each process instance or case, such as request number, order number, etc. For deeper analysis, it is recommended to add up to sixty additional custom fields. This will provide richer context data about each case and enhance the analysis. <br/><br/> Now that the data is loaded, let’s look at how process mining provides an end-to-end view of the account closure process. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Click the **Model** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/model.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We are looking at the end-to-end process for Focus Bank’s account closure process. This is provided here in the Model view perspective. <br/><br/> The business data imported from Focus Bank’s applications is used to automatically create and visualize the end-to-end account closure process, including all activities and paths. The account closure process spans multiple departments and business applications, all from which process mining algorithms correlate business data. <br/><br/> The darker color of an activity box indicates the activity was performed more frequently. For example, removing online access to the account (here labeled 'BO Service Closure') is dark blue because it is performed for most account closures. The same with the process flow lines. The darker the flow lines, the more frequent the process path is followed. For example, the flow line from 'BO Service Closure' to 'Close Reservation' is performed frequently and therefore has a darker flow line. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Analyzing the process</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Case variant analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | From this visualization, we’ll start to analyze the discovered process. First, we’ll look at the various process paths taken to complete each account closure request. We call this *case variant analysis*. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click the **Case variant** (double arrow) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/case-variant.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Each account closure request is called a case. A process variant is the unique path a case takes to complete the account closure process (from start to end). Here we see the list of unique process variants with the percentage each is followed. This shows which paths are most frequently followed. For example, the most frequently followed path is taken about 36% of the time. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Click the first variant. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/variant.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | When we select the first process variant, the visualization updates to display the steps unique to that variant. This path is taking almost twenty days on average to complete each account closure request. The most frequent variant is not meeting our regulatory requirement to complete the account closure within fourteen days. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Reference model analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Click the **Model conformance** (eye) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/model-conformance.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We’ve completed our first view of process analysis. Let’s see how the account closure process behaves with what was expected. <br/><br/> Focus Bank spent significant time mapping out their processes, including the account closure process. They published a “reference model” but had no way to check the reference model against what they were really doing. They simply had to hope the process was being performed as intended. Without process mining, the bank has no way to validate how the process is really being performed. <br/><br/> Using the process mining tool, the bank imported their Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models from IBM Blueworks Live, which is a cloud-based collaborative process modeling application. This enabled them to compare the documented process to this data-driven (actual) model. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.2 | In the drop-down list, select **Reference** to show the reference model (i.e., the BlueWorks Live model). Select **Data-derived** to show the data-driven model (i.e., the process mining model). Then click **Compare**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/pulldown.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By selecting 'Reference,' we visualize the reference model. <br/><br/> By selecting 'Data-derived,' we visualize the data-derived model. The data-derived model looks more complex. There are differences between what people thought the process should be and what is really occurring. <br/><br/> By selecting 'Compare,' we visualize the differences between the two models. A red-highlighted box is an activity occurring during real-world process execution but not included in the reference process. We see there are five such activities highlighted in red. As detailed in the comparison chart on the right, all these activities: 1) add significant time to completing account closure, 2) add significant cost, and 3) occur with significant frequency. Most notable is the unexpected activity 'Complete Account Removal.' In the reference model, we expected to remove the account with the 'BO Service Closure' activity. However, the data-derived model shows that an additional step, 'Complete Account Removal,' was needed to complete over 8,000 account closure requests. <br/><br/> A yellow box or arrow indicates the activity or process flow line are only present in the reference model. Blue boxes (dark or light blue depending on the frequency) indicate the activity is present in both models. Black arrows indicate the process flow line is present in both models. <br/><br/> We also see the impact of time and cost on not following the reference model. With an activity that follows the reference model, it takes about 18 days per case. However, when we don't follow the reference model, it takes an average of over 26 days. Not only are unexpected tasks being performed, but the expected tasks are taking longer than intended. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.3 | Return to the main screen by clicking the **Model conformance** (eye) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/model-conformance.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.3** | **Performance management** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Process mining provides various ways to analyze the performance of the account closure process. The primary dimensions to consider are time, cost, and rework. For each of these dimensions, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined and visualized in the analysis. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1 | Click **Frequency** (1). Select **Average duration** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/frequency.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s see how the account closure process is performing based on time. 'BO Service Closure' is one of the activities taking the most time within the process. On average it takes more than a week to complete the activity. Since almost every case flows through this activity, this is our fundamental process bottleneck. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.2 | Click **KPI palette**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/kpi-palette.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Next, let’s consider KPI measurement.  Defining KPIs for the process facilitates process analysis. KPIs for individual activity durations provide insights into whether actual durations are meeting expectations. <br/><br/> The KPI view indicates three of the average activity durations (highlighted in red) are not meeting expectations, including 'BO Service Closure.' In addition, a few activities for account closure (highlighted in yellow) are at risk of not meeting expectations. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Generating a BPMN model</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **BPMN generation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Focus Bank generated a standard BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) diagram of the Account Closure process. Just like the other data-driven views, this model is generated from actual process data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **BPMN** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bpmn.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The account closure activities, swim lanes, decision points, and process flows are shown in the BPMN diagram. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Mining for rules</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Rules mining** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Since the BPMN model was generated from actual account closure data, each decision point in the model has real data behind it. Clicking each decision box shows the results of what we refer to as rules mining. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click the decision gateway labeled **GW-XOR-19** (after **Liquidate Account**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/decision-gateway.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | For example, we can see why the account closure requires the extra step 'Make Adjustment.' It happens based on the status of the account closure request. <br/><br/> We can export the BPMN and decision mining rules to workflow and decision management tools, such as IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **Close**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/rules-overview.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click the **Model** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/click-model.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Mining desktop tasks</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **5.1** | **Task mining introduction** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now, let’s focus on the bottleneck caused by the 'BO Service Closure' activity we found through the activity duration analysis. We identified the bottleneck but need more information to fully understand why it is happening. Task mining provides details of what is happening during the 'BO Service Closure' activity at the desktop level. <br/><br/> Task mining complements process mining by providing analysis of activities performed on an individual’s desktop. Task mining records, analyzes, and generates insights about user interactions with software applications. Think of task mining as replacing traditional time and motion studies. <br/><br/> We’re able to combine the server activity with the desktop activity to get a complete view of how the process is performed, including where specific individuals or teams are spending their time. This approach to process discovery helps identify opportunities for automation. <br/><br/> We can drill down into 'BO Service Closure' to see the resources performing the activity. This table shows that the group called 'BOC' is performing most of the work (96% of the time). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Click the **BO Service Closure** activity (1). Then click **Statistics** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo_service_closure.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | In this case, we will want to record users in the 'BOC' group, since they perform this activity 96% of the time. If necessary, we could record multiple groups of users to complete our task mining analysis. Once the task mining data is recorded, it is integrated into the process flow discovered in the process mining model. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Close the window by clicking the **X** in the corner. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo-service-closure.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Click the **BO Service Closure** activity. Click **Task Mining**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/task-mining.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | A new window opens with the task mining view for the 'BO Service Closure' activity. All the capabilities we reviewed for process mining are available for task mining. We see the frequency of each step of the 'BO Service Closure' activity. These are the desktop steps needed to complete this activity, such as using the software applications and websites needed to close the account. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.4 | Click **Frequency** (1), then **Average Duration** (2), and then the **Case Variant** (double arrow) icon (3) to view the variants. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/average-duration.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can view the variants for this activity.  The most frequent variant occurs just over 50% of the time.  Therefore, automating the first variant would impact at least half of the total account closures. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.2** | **Task mining analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Next, let's perform a deeper analysis of the 'BO Service Closure' task. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Click the **Boxes** icon in the top right corner (1). From the drop-down list, select **Analytics** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/analytics.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Analytic views, such as this one, can be created by business users and shared within your organization. As you discover and analyze new processes, you can create and share new views as needed. This level of analysis is used to determine the benefits, such as Return on Investment (ROI), that can be realized from automation. <br/><br/> The discovered task model and variants appear on the left. For each variant, we’ve discovered the individual sub-tasks that compose the 'BO Service Closure' task. In the center, we see the productivity by sub-task. Each sub-task time is composed of: <br/> • *Productive time*: Actual time spent on each specific sub-task <br/> • *Idle time*: Time spent away from the desktop or not working on any monitored tasks <br/> • *Time spent on other activities*: Time spent on other monitored tasks <br/><br/> This analysis reveals the potential impact of how much time we would save from automation. It is quite common for analysts to base their ROI analysis on total sub-task times because they do not realize or can’t measure the idle time and time spent on other tasks. With task mining, we have identified the actual time spent on a specific task as we build our business case for prioritization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | In the **Time Consumed by Application** panel at the bottom, hover over any of the activities to see what applications are used and are in the **Completion Statistics** panel to show more detail. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/panel.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We also see the time spent in the individual applications used to complete the 'BO Service Closure' task. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>6 - Using simulation to optimize the process</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **6.1** | **Simulation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We identified opportunities to address the two main problems with the Account Closure process: (1) time to complete and (2) execution cost. Before acting, it is critical for the bank to understand the impact of planned changes and the expected outcome. The bank used simulation to predict the benefits of making changes to the process. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1 | Click the **BPMN** tab (1) and then **Simulation** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bpmn-2.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.2 | Select **New simulation** (1), provide a **Simulation title** (2), and click **Confirm** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/simulation.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | As we consider possible process improvements, the bank compared the modified process to the currently executing process. This enabled them to identify which changes would yield the greatest business benefits.  They were therefore able to validate the business case before making the investment to change the bank’s process. <br/><br/> The bank used simulation to determine the impact of changes to individual activities and to the end-to-end process. They started with a simulation scenario that was pre-loaded with the historical account closure process data. From there, they were able to change the simulation parameters, run the simulation and compare the actual process to the simulated scenario. <br/><br/> For the Account Closure process, the bank focused on not meeting their requirement of fourteen days to process the request and the suspected high execution cost.  Their previous analysis identified the main process bottleneck was 'BO Service Closure.' |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.3 | Scroll down to show different activities. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/simulation-settings.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | From here the bank can start with historical process data and change staffing levels, work hours, date ranges, etc. They can also filter by business data, such as region, to isolate or compare individual locations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.4 | Scroll to the **BO Service Closure** activity. <br/><br/> Highlight the following: <br/> •\t**Settings** – Change staff availability, total service time and actual working time <br/> •\t**Scheduling** – Change hours of operation <br/> •\t**RPA** – Refer to this as automation (vs. Robotic Process Automation or RPA). Change the percentage of this for any type of automation to solve the problem. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo-service-closure-activity.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Using process mining, the bank identified the bottleneck caused by the 'BO Service Closure' activity. They further identified with task mining that over 50% of the tasks for this activity follow the same steps to complete. They believed the activity could be fully automated due to the low number of task variants. They simulated the outcome if this step were to be automated with RPA. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.5 | Under **Robotic quote**, change the percentage of automation to **100%**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/percentage.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The bank expects this to have a positive impact due to the expected decrease in wait times for this task. This will also free up resources, which will reduce wait times for other tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.6 | Click **Run Simulation**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/run-simulation.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/><br/> You will see the following simulation results: <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/process-details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The bank is now able see the results of making this change from the “as is” model compared to the “to be” model. With this new automation, the bank is expected to reduce the average end-to-end account closure time from about 21 days to under 13 days while also reducing the average cost of each case. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nUsing a customer account closure example, we’ve shown how process mining is used to discover and analyze business processes and identify areas for improvement.

The bank is required to complete all account closure requests within fourteen days. The bank knows it is not achieving this requirement, but is not sure why. Additionally, the bank performed over 60,000 account closures per year and suspects it could reduce process execution costs. However, it is unsure where to start. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.2** | **Visualize the end-to-end process** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Analyzing processes in process mining starts with importing log files from the applications used in your business processes.

For example, removing online access to the account (here labeled 'BO Service Closure') is dark blue because it is performed for most account closures. The same with the process flow lines. The darker the flow lines, the more frequent the process path is followed. For example, the flow line from 'BO Service Closure' to 'Close Reservation' is performed frequently and therefore has a darker flow line. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Analyzing the process</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Case variant analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | From this visualization, we’ll start to analyze the discovered process. First, we’ll look at the various process paths taken to complete each account closure request. We call this *case variant analysis*. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click the **Case variant** (double arrow) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/case-variant.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Each account closure request is called a case. A process variant is the unique path a case takes to complete the account closure process (from start to end). Here we see the list of unique process variants with the percentage each is followed. This shows which paths are most frequently followed. For example, the most frequently followed path is taken about 36% of the time. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Click the first variant. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/variant.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | When we select the first process variant, the visualization updates to display the steps unique to that variant. This path is taking almost twenty days on average to complete each account closure request. The most frequent variant is not meeting our regulatory requirement to complete the account closure within fourteen days. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Reference model analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Click the **Model conformance** (eye) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/model-conformance.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We’ve completed our first view of process analysis. Let’s see how the account closure process behaves with what was expected. <br/><br/> Focus Bank spent significant time mapping out their processes, including the account closure process. They published a “reference model” but had no way to check the reference model against what they were really doing. They simply had to hope the process was being performed as intended. Without process mining, the bank has no way to validate how the process is really being performed. <br/><br/> Using the process mining tool, the bank imported their Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models from IBM Blueworks Live, which is a cloud-based collaborative process modeling application. This enabled them to compare the documented process to this data-driven (actual) model. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.2 | In the drop-down list, select **Reference** to show the reference model (i.e., the BlueWorks Live model). Select **Data-derived** to show the data-driven model (i.e., the process mining model). Then click **Compare**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/pulldown.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | By selecting 'Reference,' we visualize the reference model. <br/><br/> By selecting 'Data-derived,' we visualize the data-derived model. The data-derived model looks more complex. There are differences between what people thought the process should be and what is really occurring. <br/><br/> By selecting 'Compare,' we visualize the differences between the two models. A red-highlighted box is an activity occurring during real-world process execution but not included in the reference process. We see there are five such activities highlighted in red. As detailed in the comparison chart on the right, all these activities: 1) add significant time to completing account closure, 2) add significant cost, and 3) occur with significant frequency. Most notable is the unexpected activity 'Complete Account Removal.' In the reference model, we expected to remove the account with the 'BO Service Closure' activity. However, the data-derived model shows that an additional step, 'Complete Account Removal,' was needed to complete over 8,000 account closure requests. <br/><br/> A yellow box or arrow indicates the activity or process flow line are only present in the reference model. Blue boxes (dark or light blue depending on the frequency) indicate the activity is present in both models. Black arrows indicate the process flow line is present in both models. <br/><br/> We also see the impact of time and cost on not following the reference model. With an activity that follows the reference model, it takes about 18 days per case. However, when we don't follow the reference model, it takes an average of over 26 days. Not only are unexpected tasks being performed, but the expected tasks are taking longer than intended. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.3 | Return to the main screen by clicking the **Model conformance** (eye) icon. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/model-conformance.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.3** | **Performance management** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Process mining provides various ways to analyze the performance of the account closure process. The primary dimensions to consider are time, cost, and rework. For each of these dimensions, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined and visualized in the analysis. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1 | Click **Frequency** (1). Select **Average duration** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/frequency.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Let’s see how the account closure process is performing based on time. 'BO Service Closure' is one of the activities taking the most time within the process. On average it takes more than a week to complete the activity. Since almost every case flows through this activity, this is our fundamental process bottleneck. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 2.3.2 | Click **KPI palette**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/kpi-palette.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Next, let’s consider KPI measurement.  Defining KPIs for the process facilitates process analysis. KPIs for individual activity durations provide insights into whether actual durations are meeting expectations. <br/><br/> The KPI view indicates three of the average activity durations (highlighted in red) are not meeting expectations, including 'BO Service Closure.' In addition, a few activities for account closure (highlighted in yellow) are at risk of not meeting expectations. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - Generating a BPMN model</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **BPMN generation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Focus Bank generated a standard BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) diagram of the Account Closure process. Just like the other data-driven views, this model is generated from actual process data. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **BPMN** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bpmn.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The account closure activities, swim lanes, decision points, and process flows are shown in the BPMN diagram. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Mining for rules</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Rules mining** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Since the BPMN model was generated from actual account closure data, each decision point in the model has real data behind it. Clicking each decision box shows the results of what we refer to as rules mining. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click the decision gateway labeled **GW-XOR-19** (after **Liquidate Account**). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/decision-gateway.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | For example, we can see why the account closure requires the extra step 'Make Adjustment.' It happens based on the status of the account closure request. <br/><br/> We can export the BPMN and decision mining rules to workflow and decision management tools, such as IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **Close**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/rules-overview.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Click the **Model** tab. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/click-model.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Mining desktop tasks</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **5.1** | **Task mining introduction** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Now, let’s focus on the bottleneck caused by the 'BO Service Closure' activity we found through the activity duration analysis. We identified the bottleneck but need more information to fully understand why it is happening. Task mining provides details of what is happening during the 'BO Service Closure' activity at the desktop level. <br/><br/> Task mining complements process mining by providing analysis of activities performed on an individual’s desktop. Task mining records, analyzes, and generates insights about user interactions with software applications. Think of task mining as replacing traditional time and motion studies. <br/><br/> We’re able to combine the server activity with the desktop activity to get a complete view of how the process is performed, including where specific individuals or teams are spending their time. This approach to process discovery helps identify opportunities for automation. <br/><br/> We can drill down into 'BO Service Closure' to see the resources performing the activity. This table shows that the group called 'BOC' is performing most of the work (96% of the time). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Click the **BO Service Closure** activity (1). Then click **Statistics** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo_service_closure.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | In this case, we will want to record users in the 'BOC' group, since they perform this activity 96% of the time. If necessary, we could record multiple groups of users to complete our task mining analysis. Once the task mining data is recorded, it is integrated into the process flow discovered in the process mining model. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Close the window by clicking the **X** in the corner. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo-service-closure.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Click the **BO Service Closure** activity. Click **Task Mining**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/task-mining.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | A new window opens with the task mining view for the 'BO Service Closure' activity. All the capabilities we reviewed for process mining are available for task mining. We see the frequency of each step of the 'BO Service Closure' activity. These are the desktop steps needed to complete this activity, such as using the software applications and websites needed to close the account. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.4 | Click **Frequency** (1), then **Average Duration** (2), and then the **Case Variant** (double arrow) icon (3) to view the variants. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/average-duration.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We can view the variants for this activity.  The most frequent variant occurs just over 50% of the time.  Therefore, automating the first variant would impact at least half of the total account closures. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.2** | **Task mining analysis** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Next, let's perform a deeper analysis of the 'BO Service Closure' task. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Click the **Boxes** icon in the top right corner (1). From the drop-down list, select **Analytics** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/analytics.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Analytic views, such as this one, can be created by business users and shared within your organization. As you discover and analyze new processes, you can create and share new views as needed. This level of analysis is used to determine the benefits, such as Return on Investment (ROI), that can be realized from automation. <br/><br/> The discovered task model and variants appear on the left. For each variant, we’ve discovered the individual sub-tasks that compose the 'BO Service Closure' task. In the center, we see the productivity by sub-task. Each sub-task time is composed of: <br/> • *Productive time*: Actual time spent on each specific sub-task <br/> • *Idle time*: Time spent away from the desktop or not working on any monitored tasks <br/> • *Time spent on other activities*: Time spent on other monitored tasks <br/><br/> This analysis reveals the potential impact of how much time we would save from automation. It is quite common for analysts to base their ROI analysis on total sub-task times because they do not realize or can’t measure the idle time and time spent on other tasks. With task mining, we have identified the actual time spent on a specific task as we build our business case for prioritization. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | In the **Time Consumed by Application** panel at the bottom, hover over any of the activities to see what applications are used and are in the **Completion Statistics** panel to show more detail. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/panel.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | We also see the time spent in the individual applications used to complete the 'BO Service Closure' task. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>6 - Using simulation to optimize the process</summary>\n<br/>\n\n| **6.1** | **Simulation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | We identified opportunities to address the two main problems with the Account Closure process: (1) time to complete and (2) execution cost. Before acting, it is critical for the bank to understand the impact of planned changes and the expected outcome. The bank used simulation to predict the benefits of making changes to the process. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1 | Click the **BPMN** tab (1) and then **Simulation** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bpmn-2.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.2 | Select **New simulation** (1), provide a **Simulation title** (2), and click **Confirm** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/simulation.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | As we consider possible process improvements, the bank compared the modified process to the currently executing process. This enabled them to identify which changes would yield the greatest business benefits.  They were therefore able to validate the business case before making the investment to change the bank’s process. <br/><br/> The bank used simulation to determine the impact of changes to individual activities and to the end-to-end process. They started with a simulation scenario that was pre-loaded with the historical account closure process data. From there, they were able to change the simulation parameters, run the simulation and compare the actual process to the simulated scenario. <br/><br/> For the Account Closure process, the bank focused on not meeting their requirement of fourteen days to process the request and the suspected high execution cost.  Their previous analysis identified the main process bottleneck was 'BO Service Closure.' |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.3 | Scroll down to show different activities. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/simulation-settings.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | From here the bank can start with historical process data and change staffing levels, work hours, date ranges, etc. They can also filter by business data, such as region, to isolate or compare individual locations. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.4 | Scroll to the **BO Service Closure** activity. <br/><br/> Highlight the following: <br/> •\t**Settings** – Change staff availability, total service time and actual working time <br/> •\t**Scheduling** – Change hours of operation <br/> •\t**RPA** – Refer to this as automation (vs. Robotic Process Automation or RPA). Change the percentage of this for any type of automation to solve the problem. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/bo-service-closure-activity.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Using process mining, the bank identified the bottleneck caused by the 'BO Service Closure' activity. They further identified with task mining that over 50% of the tasks for this activity follow the same steps to complete. They believed the activity could be fully automated due to the low number of task variants. They simulated the outcome if this step were to be automated with RPA. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.5 | Under **Robotic quote**, change the percentage of automation to **100%**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/percentage.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The bank expects this to have a positive impact due to the expected decrease in wait times for this task. This will also free up resources, which will reduce wait times for other tasks. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.6 | Click **Run Simulation**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/run-simulation.png\" width=\"800\" /> <br/><br/> You will see the following simulation results: <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/images/process-details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The bank is now able see the results of making this change from the “as is” model compared to the “to be” model. With this new automation, the bank is expected to reduce the average end-to-end account closure time from about 21 days to under 13 days while also reducing the average cost of each case. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nUsing a customer account closure example, we’ve shown how process mining is used to discover and analyze business processes and identify areas for improvement. Before process mining, we had very little knowledge of how to improve regulatory compliance or reduce cost. <br/><br/> We leveraged process mining to analyze the current process, including comparing the current process performance to our expected model. Next, we identified opportunities to alleviate the problems. We used task mining to drill to the desktop activity level. Finally, we simulated how we could use automation to get back into compliance and reduce overall costs.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-business-automation-process-and-task-mining/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
