Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above.

Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/mysupport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>\n\n<br/>\n\nEnsure that you have completed steps 1-6 in the **2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster** section above.\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the collapsible section to open them. Change the default values parameters using the table below.\n\n<br/>\n\nIf you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href=\"https://mailtrap.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mailtrap.io</a> account. Mailtrap is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.\n\n<br/>\n\n| FIELD | ACTION |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| **demoPreparation:** | Set to false |\n| **demoAPICEmailAddress:** | If you’re using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use ’apicadmin@example.com’ to be safe — example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you’re using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read. |\n| **demoAPICMailServerPort:** | If you’re using mailtrap, leave this as 2525. |\n| **demoAPICMialServerUsername:** | Set this to your mailtrap username. |\n| **demoAPICMailServerPassword:** | Set this to your mailtrap password. |\n\n<br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-install-param-false.png\" width=\"800\" />\n\n<br/>\n\n2.
