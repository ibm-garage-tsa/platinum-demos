To reserve your ROKS instance, follow these steps: <br/><br/>\n\n1. To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) ROKS 4.6 cluster on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/611bf99bd21122001e42d3fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and complete the form. (If you do not have a sales opportunity, select the purpose **Practice / Self-Education** to create a two-week reservation.)\n\n<br/>\n\n<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong> If there are no clusters availabile in Express installation, go ahead with the Custom installation. While the process is the same, Express is a 5 minute request (because you will receive a pre-created ROKS cluster from a queue), and custom is a 2 hour provisioning (because the ROKS cluster will be installed, behind the scenes, from scratch for you).</InlineNotification>\n\n<br/>\n\n2. You will receive a confirmation email confirming the instance is provisioning.<br/><br/>\n\n3. You will receive a second email once the environment is provisioned. You should expect this to take about 30 minutes. This email contains information, such as URLs, allowing you to connect to the instance.\n<br/>If you have issues connecting to your instance, please contact <a href=\"https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0124J683GW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#itz-techzone-support</a>.\n<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/prep-image006.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<span id=\"ROKSinstall\"></span>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n1.
