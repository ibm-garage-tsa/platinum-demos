Turbonomic recommends upsizing the existing memory from 100 MB to 228 MB. The analysis shows that if this action is taken, it will result in a reduction of memory utilization from 82% to 36%. This memory upsizing will mitigate the detected risk of congestion for memory resources. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Analyze an efficiency recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When the architect initially does sizing, the values are based on best guesses and taking a safer path, typically resulting in the overprovisioning of resources. There is often opportunity to reclaim unused expensive resources and save costs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, select **Workload Controllers** (1). Select the **ratings** service (2), and click **DETAILS** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Action-Details.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic platform has discovered that the RobotShop 'Ratings' service (a microservice to accept user feedback; i.e. five stars) is overprovisioned with memory. Let's take a look at the recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Point out the increase in memory utilization as a result of the recommended memory downsizing. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Ratings-Recommendation.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | An efficiency recommendation is being made to reduce the memory of the ratings pod from 1 GB to 232 MB. The downsizing will improve memory utilization from 11% to 47.4%, without impacting overall service performance. <br/><br/> In addition to providing detailed analytics behind the recommendation, Turbonomic is able to take the remedial action without having to jump to other tools or involve other cumbersome IT processes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | Click the **x** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Ratings-Expand-Actions-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze a workload consolidation recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The performance of a service depends on the availability of compute resources to the encapsulating pod. The pod runs on a node, so the performance and efficiency of the node matters. We will see how Turbonomic intelligently and proactively redistributes workloads in real time to better optimize the full stack. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | On the **RobotShop** supply chain, click **Namespace**.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/RobotShop-Namespace.png\" width=\"500\" />\n| **Narration** | A Namespace is a logical pool of resources that manages workloads. The Top Services chart shows that the RobotShop rabbitmq service can benefit from some performance and efficiency actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | On the **Service-robot-shop/rabbitmq** row, click **ACTIONS**.<br/><br/>  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/RabbitMQ-Actions-Click.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | In the **Action Center**, under **MOVE**, select **Container Pods** (1). Then, click **DETAILS** (2) in the **robotshop/rabbitmq** line.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/action-center.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Review the analytics behind the workload consolidation recommendation.<br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/rabbitmq-Action-Details-1.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The overall benefit of this recommendation is the ability to *consolidate* workloads on a fewer number of nodes and thereby drive down operational costs. This Move action will migrate the workload from worker node1 to worker node7. This will approximately double the resource utilization on worker node7, increasing memory usage from 12% to 24% and CPU utilization from 6% to 11%. This still leaves worker node7 with enough capacity to absorb additional workloads. However, we were able to retain the capacity of worker node1. <br/><br/> Turbonomic's analysis indicates that worker node1, currently hosting the RobotShop rabbitmq service, is underutilized and that by moving this pod to worker node7, overall cluster efficiency can be improved. |\n \n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Automating actions</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Automate the execution of actions and eliminate manual intervention** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Though Turbonomic allows you to initiate action from the platform with the click of a button, it is a best practice to automate the execution of these actions. <br/><br/> We will now define an automation policy that enables you to automate the platform-derived actions without having to jump into multiple tools. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click **SETTINGS** (1) and select **Policies** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Settings.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **NEW AUTOMATION POLICY**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/New-Policy.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Select **Container Pod**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Container-Pod.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.4 | Give the policy a **NAME**. Then, expand **AUTOMATION AND ORCHESTRATION** (2) and click **ADD ACTION** (3) to define how an action is accepted. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy-1.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.5 | Fill out the **Automation and Orchestration** panel.<br/><br/> Define the **ACTION TYPE** that will be automated by this automation policy: **Move**, **Suspend**, **Provision** (1).<br/><br/>Set **ACTION GENERATION** to **Generate Actions** (2).<br/><br/>Set **ACTION ACCEPTANCE** to **Automatic** (3).<br/><br/>**Note**: Do **not** click **Submit**, as this is a read-only environment.<br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy-2.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Once the automation policy is saved, it will go into effect. All configured actions will now be executed automatically. <br/><br/> The main benefit and best practice of Turbonomic is to execute an increasing number of actions automatically. Removing human intervention and leveraging automation will maintain application performance and improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> Although we have demonstrated how actions can be taken automatically from Turbonomic, it is typical that IT organizations first build a level of trust where actions are initially triggered manually by a human operator. And as the organization's level of comfort matures over time, we evolve into a semi-automatic and then a relatively fully automatic set of executions, where a number of actions are being taken automatically. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we showed how Home Robots Inc. leveraged Turbonomic to assure the performance of the applications and improve the operational efficiency of the supporting application infrastructure.

Turbonomic recommends upsizing the existing memory from 100 MB to 228 MB. The analysis shows that if this action is taken, it will result in a reduction of memory utilization from 82% to 36%. This memory upsizing will mitigate the detected risk of congestion for memory resources. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Analyze an efficiency recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When the architect initially does sizing, the values are based on best guesses and taking a safer path, typically resulting in the overprovisioning of resources. There is often opportunity to reclaim unused expensive resources and save costs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, select **Workload Controllers** (1). Select the **ratings** service (2), and click **DETAILS** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Action-Details.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic platform has discovered that the RobotShop 'Ratings' service (a microservice to accept user feedback; i.e. five stars) is overprovisioned with memory. Let's take a look at the recommendation. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Point out the increase in memory utilization as a result of the recommended memory downsizing. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Ratings-Recommendation.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | An efficiency recommendation is being made to reduce the memory of the ratings pod from 1 GB to 232 MB. The downsizing will improve memory utilization from 11% to 47.4%, without impacting overall service performance. <br/><br/> In addition to providing detailed analytics behind the recommendation, Turbonomic is able to take the remedial action without having to jump to other tools or involve other cumbersome IT processes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | Click the **x** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Ratings-Expand-Actions-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze a workload consolidation recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The performance of a service depends on the availability of compute resources to the encapsulating pod. The pod runs on a node, so the performance and efficiency of the node matters. We will see how Turbonomic intelligently and proactively redistributes workloads in real time to better optimize the full stack. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | On the **RobotShop** supply chain, click **Namespace**.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/RobotShop-Namespace.png\" width=\"500\" />\n| **Narration** | A Namespace is a logical pool of resources that manages workloads.

This Move action will migrate the workload from worker node1 to worker node7. This will approximately double the resource utilization on worker node7, increasing memory usage from 12% to 24% and CPU utilization from 6% to 11%. This still leaves worker node7 with enough capacity to absorb additional workloads. However, we were able to retain the capacity of worker node1. <br/><br/> Turbonomic's analysis indicates that worker node1, currently hosting the RobotShop rabbitmq service, is underutilized and that by moving this pod to worker node7, overall cluster efficiency can be improved. |\n \n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Automating actions</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Automate the execution of actions and eliminate manual intervention** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Though Turbonomic allows you to initiate action from the platform with the click of a button, it is a best practice to automate the execution of these actions. <br/><br/> We will now define an automation policy that enables you to automate the platform-derived actions without having to jump into multiple tools. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click **SETTINGS** (1) and select **Policies** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Settings.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **NEW AUTOMATION POLICY**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/New-Policy.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Select **Container Pod**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Container-Pod.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.4 | Give the policy a **NAME**.

All configured actions will now be executed automatically. <br/><br/> The main benefit and best practice of Turbonomic is to execute an increasing number of actions automatically. Removing human intervention and leveraging automation will maintain application performance and improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> Although we have demonstrated how actions can be taken automatically from Turbonomic, it is typical that IT organizations first build a level of trust where actions are initially triggered manually by a human operator. And as the organization's level of comfort matures over time, we evolve into a semi-automatic and then a relatively fully automatic set of executions, where a number of actions are being taken automatically. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we showed how Home Robots Inc. leveraged Turbonomic to assure the performance of the applications and improve the operational efficiency of the supporting application infrastructure.
