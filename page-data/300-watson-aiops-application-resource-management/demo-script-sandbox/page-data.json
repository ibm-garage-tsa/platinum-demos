Application performance, therefore, is one of highest CIO priorities.\n\n<br/>\n\nHome Robots Inc. is a fully digital company selling innovative \"household chores\" robots globally via its RobotShop online marketplace. Clients browse and purchase through RobotShop's microservices-based cloud native app. Promotions and other marketing events, however, generate unpredictable load patterns. This often results in poor application performance and bad customer experiences. Without full stack visibility, IT Ops teams tend to either over or under-provision resources based on best guesses - which is highly inefficient, costly and risky.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, I'll show you how IBM Turbonomic, a solution based on Application Resource Management, helps SREs and IT Ops teams proactively assure application performance and operational efficiency across their mission critical deployments. We will: <br/>\n• See how Turbonomic stitches together a full-stack view from business applications down to the supporting infrastructure <br/>\n• Examine the resource optimization recommendations generated by AI-based platform analytics <br/>\n• Demonstrate how to automate execution of platform-derived \"actions\" <br/>\n\n<br/>\n\n**Note**: This demo will be focus on application resource management in private clouds.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1 - Getting a global view of the applications and their infrastructure dependencies</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **1.1** | **Ingest data from observability platforms and other sources** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Turbonomic requires configuration and operational performance data to make resource optimization recommendations.

Notice the recommendation to upsize 100 MB to 228 MB.<br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/performance-action-details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The graphs show an imminent congestion for the RobotShop cart pod, based on a percentile analysis from the 30 day observation period. Turbonomic recommends upsizing the existing memory from 100 MB to 228 MB. The analysis shows that if this action is taken, it will result in a reduction of memory utilization from 82% to 36%. This memory upsizing will mitigate the detected risk of congestion for memory resources. |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Analyze an efficiency recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | When the architect initially does sizing, the values are based on best guesses and taking a safer path, typically resulting in the overprovisioning of resources. There is often opportunity to reclaim unused expensive resources and save costs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, select **Workload Controllers** (1). Select the **ratings** service (2), and click **DETAILS** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Action-Details.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic platform has discovered that the RobotShop ratings service is overprovisioned with memory. An efficiency recommendation is being made to reduce the memory of the ratings pod from 1 GB to 232 MB. The downsizing will improve memory utilization from 11% to 47.4%, without impacting overall service performance. <br/><br/> In addition to all the detailed analytics behind the recommendation, observe that Turbonomic is able to take the remedial action without having to jump to other tools or involve other cumbersome IT processes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Click the **x** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Effciency-Ratings-Expand-Actions-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze a workload consolidation recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The performance of a service depends on the availability of compute resources to the encapsulating pod. The pod runs on a node, so the performance and efficiency of the node matters.

This Move action will approximately double the resource utilization on worker node7, increasing memory usage from 12% to 24% and CPU utilization from 6% to 11%. <br/><br/>Turbonomic analysis indicates that worker node1, currently hosting the RobotShop rabbitmq service, is underutilized and that by moving this pod to worker node7, overall cluster efficiency can be improved. |\n \n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Automating actions</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Automate action execution and eliminate manual intervention** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Though Turbonomic allows you to take action from the platform with the click of a button, it is a best practice to automate these actions. <br/><br/>We will now define an automation policy that enables you to automate the platform-derived actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | From **Settings**, click **Policies**. Click **New Automation Policy**. Select **Container Pod**. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | We will give the policy a **NAME** and **POLICY SCHEDULE**.

Select the **ratings** service (2), and click **DETAILS** (3). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Efficiency-Action-Details.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic platform has discovered that the RobotShop ratings service is overprovisioned with memory. An efficiency recommendation is being made to reduce the memory of the ratings pod from 1 GB to 232 MB. The downsizing will improve memory utilization from 11% to 47.4%, without impacting overall service performance. <br/><br/> In addition to all the detailed analytics behind the recommendation, observe that Turbonomic is able to take the remedial action without having to jump to other tools or involve other cumbersome IT processes. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Click the **x** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Effciency-Ratings-Expand-Actions-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze a workload consolidation recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The performance of a service depends on the availability of compute resources to the encapsulating pod. The pod runs on a node, so the performance and efficiency of the node matters. We will see how Turbonomic intelligently and proactively redistributes workloads in real time to better optimize the full stack. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | On the **RobotShop** supply chain, click **Namespace**.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/RobotShop-Namespace.png\" width=\"500\" />\n| **Narration** | A Namespace is a logical pool of resources that manages workloads. The Top Services chart shows that the RobotShop rabbitmq service can benefit from some performance and efficiency actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | On the **Service-robot-shop/rabbitmq** row, click **ACTIONS**.<br/><br/>  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/RabbitMQ-Actions-Click.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Under **Move**, select **Container Pods** (1), then click **DETAILS** (2) in the **robotshop/rabbitmq** line.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/action-center.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Review the analytics behind the workload consolidation recommendation.<br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/rabbitmq-Action-Details-1.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | The overall benefit of this recommendation is the ability to consolidate workloads on a fewer number of nodes and thereby drive down operational costs. This Move action will approximately double the resource utilization on worker node7, increasing memory usage from 12% to 24% and CPU utilization from 6% to 11%. <br/><br/>Turbonomic analysis indicates that worker node1, currently hosting the RobotShop rabbitmq service, is underutilized and that by moving this pod to worker node7, overall cluster efficiency can be improved. |\n \n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Automating actions</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Automate action execution and eliminate manual intervention** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | Though Turbonomic allows you to take action from the platform with the click of a button, it is a best practice to automate these actions. <br/><br/>We will now define an automation policy that enables you to automate the platform-derived actions. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | From **Settings**, click **Policies**. Click **New Automation Policy**. Select **Container Pod**. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | We will give the policy a **NAME** and **POLICY SCHEDULE**. Then, we will define how an action is accepted. <br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy-1.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Fill out the **Automation and Orchestration** panel.<br/><br/> Define the **ACTION TYPE** that will be automated by this automation policy: **Move**, **Suspend**, **Provision** (1).<br/><br/>Set **ACTION GENERATION** to **Generate Actions** (2).<br/><br/>Set **ACTION ACCEPTANCE** to **Automatic** (3).<br/><br/>**Note**: Do **not** click **Submit**, as this is a read-only environment.<br/> <br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy-2.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Once the automation policy is saved, it will go into effect. All configured actions will now be executed automatically.<br/><br/>The main benefit and best practice of Turbonomic is to execute an increasing number of actions automatically. Removing human intervention and leveraging automation will maintain application performance and improve operational efficiency. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we showed you how Turbonomic can assure the performance of your applications and improve the operational efficiency of the supporting application infrastructure.
