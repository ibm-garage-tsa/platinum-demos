Point out the recommendation to upsize the virtual CPU limit from 200 mCores to 500 mCores. <br/><br/> **Note**: Since this is a dynamic system, the metrics displayed on your screen may not necessarily reflect the exact numbers in the screenshot. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/2-Payment_Expand.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | CPU throttling directly impacts the response time of a service and therefore user experience. Turbonomic observes and tracks CPU throttling. In the case of RobotShop, the response time latency of the payment service can adversely impact the ecommerce checkout experience. Given the rate of throttling being observed, Turbonomic recommends increasing the CPU limit from 200 mCores to 500 mCores, thereby reducing the CPU throttling from 19.2% to 3.1%. Proactively alleviating CPU congestion pressures by providing these analytics-driven recommendations helps keep the application in the desired state where it meets its defined service-level objectives (SLOs). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Click the **X** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/2-Payment_X.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Analyze a proactive workload redistribution recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The underlying cloud native environment to which the RobotShop microservices are deployed is highly dynamic. <br/><br/> The initial node to which a pod was placed may not always remain the most optimal place to continue executing this workload. An unhealthy application can cause cascading issues, potentially impacting healthy neighboring pods. Additional node capacity may present alternative optimal placement options that were not available at the time when this pod was initially placed. <br/><br/> Continuously and proactively redistributing workloads, in line with shifting load patterns and available capacity, helps assure application performance and infrastructure operational efficiency. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, under **MOVE**, select **Container Pods** (1). Then, click **DETAILS** (2) in the **robot-shop/payment** row. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Review the efficiency action details. Point out the recommendation to relocate the payment pod from where it is currently running on worker node 3 to worker node 6. <br/><br/> **Note**: Since this is a dynamic system, the metrics displayed on your screen may not necessarily reflect the exact numbers in the screenshot. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move_Details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | If the underlying node is getting congested, it will attempt to identify an alternate node with more capacity. If, on the other hand, as is the case here, the underlying node is underutilized, it makes sense to proactively redistribute the workload to other appropriate nodes to improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> The Turbonomic analysis engine computes the current and possible future state of the cluster if the Move action is accepted for execution. As we can observe here, the migration of workloads from worker node 3 to worker node 6 will result in a marginal increase of virtual CPU utilization from 7.1% to 10% and an increase of virtual memory consumption from 15.5% to 20.8% of worker node 6. <br/><br/> Continuous redistribution of workloads helps better optimize overall cluster resources in terms of performance and cost of ownership. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | Click the **X** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move_X.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze an intelligent cluster scaling recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic analysis engine is continuously exploring opportunities to optimize overall cluster efficiency, essentially balancing cluster capacity with workload demand. <br/><br/> Pods consume resources from the underlying nodes on which they are placed. Nodes are represented as virtual machines (VMs) in the supply chain. When pods begin experiencing performance issues due to diminishing resources at the underlying node level, Turbonomic will provide early recommendations to provision additional cluster capacity. <br/><br/> On the other hand, it will seek out opportunities to consolidate workloads on a fewer number of nodes, thereby driving down operational costs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, under **SUSPEND**, select **Virtual Machines** (1). Then, click **DETAILS** (2) in the **worker3.vader.coc-ibm.com** row. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/8-Suspend.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Review the action details. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/9-Suspend_Details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Executing the Suspend action will result in reclaiming and possibly repurposing the compute resources of worker node 3. <br/><br/> These actions enhance overall cluster operational efficiency and naturally yield significant costs savings, while not compromising application performance and availability. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | Click the **X** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/9-Suspend_X.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Automating actions</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you want to demonstrate how to create and configure an automation policy, you will need additional credentials.

This significantly enhances operator productivity. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click **SETTINGS** (1) and select **Policies** (2). <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Settings.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **NEW AUTOMATION POLICY**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/New-Policy.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Select **Container Pod**. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Container-Pod.png\" width=\"300\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.4 | Give the policy a custom **NAME**. Then, expand **AUTOMATION AND ORCHESTRATION** (2) and click **ADD ACTION** (3) to define how an action is accepted. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy-1.jpg\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.5 | Fill out the **Automation and Orchestration** panel: <br/> • Set the **ACTION TYPE** to **Move** (1). <br/> • Set **ACTION GENERATION** to **Generate Actions** (2). <br/> • Set **ACTION ACCEPTANCE** to **Automatic** (3). <br/><br/> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Do **NOT** click **Submit**, as this is a read-only environment. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/Automation-Policy.png\" width=\"500\" /> |\n| **Narration** | Once the automation policy is saved, it will go into effect. All configured actions will now be executed automatically. <br/><br/> The main benefit and best practice of Turbonomic is to execute the platform-derived actions automatically. The underlying goal is to reduce or remove human intervention and leverage automation to maintain application performance and improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> Although we have demonstrated how actions can be initiated automatically from Turbonomic, typically IT organizations manually execute actions until they are confident that the actions are trustworthy.

Turbonomic observes and tracks CPU throttling. In the case of RobotShop, the response time latency of the payment service can adversely impact the ecommerce checkout experience. Given the rate of throttling being observed, Turbonomic recommends increasing the CPU limit from 200 mCores to 500 mCores, thereby reducing the CPU throttling from 19.2% to 3.1%. Proactively alleviating CPU congestion pressures by providing these analytics-driven recommendations helps keep the application in the desired state where it meets its defined service-level objectives (SLOs). |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Click the **X** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/2-Payment_X.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.2** | **Analyze a proactive workload redistribution recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The underlying cloud native environment to which the RobotShop microservices are deployed is highly dynamic. <br/><br/> The initial node to which a pod was placed may not always remain the most optimal place to continue executing this workload. An unhealthy application can cause cascading issues, potentially impacting healthy neighboring pods. Additional node capacity may present alternative optimal placement options that were not available at the time when this pod was initially placed. <br/><br/> Continuously and proactively redistributing workloads, in line with shifting load patterns and available capacity, helps assure application performance and infrastructure operational efficiency. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, under **MOVE**, select **Container Pods** (1). Then, click **DETAILS** (2) in the **robot-shop/payment** row. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Review the efficiency action details. Point out the recommendation to relocate the payment pod from where it is currently running on worker node 3 to worker node 6. <br/><br/> **Note**: Since this is a dynamic system, the metrics displayed on your screen may not necessarily reflect the exact numbers in the screenshot. <br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move_Details.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n| **Narration** | If the underlying node is getting congested, it will attempt to identify an alternate node with more capacity. If, on the other hand, as is the case here, the underlying node is underutilized, it makes sense to proactively redistribute the workload to other appropriate nodes to improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> The Turbonomic analysis engine computes the current and possible future state of the cluster if the Move action is accepted for execution. As we can observe here, the migration of workloads from worker node 3 to worker node 6 will result in a marginal increase of virtual CPU utilization from 7.1% to 10% and an increase of virtual memory consumption from 15.5% to 20.8% of worker node 6. <br/><br/> Continuous redistribution of workloads helps better optimize overall cluster resources in terms of performance and cost of ownership. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | Click the **X** in the upper right corner to close the **Action Details** page.<br/><br/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/images/7-Move_X.png\" width=\"800\" /> |\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.3** | **Analyze an intelligent cluster scaling recommendation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Narration** | The Turbonomic analysis engine is continuously exploring opportunities to optimize overall cluster efficiency, essentially balancing cluster capacity with workload demand. <br/><br/> Pods consume resources from the underlying nodes on which they are placed. Nodes are represented as virtual machines (VMs) in the supply chain. When pods begin experiencing performance issues due to diminishing resources at the underlying node level, Turbonomic will provide early recommendations to provision additional cluster capacity. <br/><br/> On the other hand, it will seek out opportunities to consolidate workloads on a fewer number of nodes, thereby driving down operational costs. |\n| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | On the **Action Center** panel, under **SUSPEND**, select **Virtual Machines** (1).

All configured actions will now be executed automatically. <br/><br/> The main benefit and best practice of Turbonomic is to execute the platform-derived actions automatically. The underlying goal is to reduce or remove human intervention and leverage automation to maintain application performance and improve operational efficiency. <br/><br/> Although we have demonstrated how actions can be initiated automatically from Turbonomic, typically IT organizations manually execute actions until they are confident that the actions are trustworthy. As the organization's level of comfort matures over time, actions are executed in an increasingly automated fashion. |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo, we showed how Home Robots Inc. leveraged Turbonomic to assure application performance and improve the operational efficiency of the supporting infrastructure. <br/><br/> We demonstrated how Turbonomic can augment a container platform and provide additional high-value capabilities, such as full-stack visibility, analytics-driven resource optimization recommendations, and automation of executing the recommended actions.\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/demo-script-sandbox.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
