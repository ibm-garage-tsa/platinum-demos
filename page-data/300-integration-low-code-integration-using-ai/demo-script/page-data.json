But going fast without the right approach, guided by real-world operational data, has caused 70% of digital transformations to fail. A new approach with automation and continuous improvement fed by AI algorithms is required. IBM Cloud Pak for Integration is a hybrid integration solution that provides an automated and closed-loop lifecycle across multiple styles of enterprise integration. With IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, companies can speed integration development, reduce costs, and maintain enhanced security, governance, and availability. Let’s see IBM Cloud Pak for Integration in action. Here I have a cloud version of the product on IBM Cloud. Let me log in. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-1-1-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-1-1-2.png) |\n\n| **1.2** | **Cloud Pak for Integration home** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Show the home page and click on **View Capabilities** |\n| **Narration** | Welcome to IBM Cloud Pak for Integration! We’re now at the home screen showing all the capabilities of the Cloud Pak brought together in one place. Specialized integration capabilities — for API management, application integration, messaging, and more — are built on top of powerful automation services. Let’s see the integration capabilities available in this Cloud Pak. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-1-2-1.png) |\n\n| **1.3** | **Cloud Pak for Integration home** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Show the **Integration capabilities** page and open the Designer (**ace-designer-demo**) |\n| **Narration** | As you can see, through a single interface you are able to access all the integration capabilities your team needs, including API management, application integration, enterprise messaging, events, and high-speed transfer. <br/><br/> In this demo, we'll use the App Connect Designer's Mapping Assist capability to speed the transformation of complex data formats used by cloud applications such as Salesforce and Insightly. Let’s open our App Connect Designer. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-1-3-1.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>2 - Creating the flow</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **2.1** | **Create flows for an API** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click **Create flows for an API** (1) <br/><br/> In the API title, replace Untitled API with **Contact API** (2) <br/><br/> In the model name, enter **Contact** and click on **Create model** (3) |\n| **Narration** | Here we are in the designer tooling. This is where we can create all our API integration flows and manage our connectivity to our services and endpoints. As we begin, there is nothing here yet, so let’s build some integration logic. Let’s see how simple it is to create our flow for an API. First, we need to create a model for our contact. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-2-1-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-2-1-2.png) |\n\n| **2.2** | **Create properties** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | In the property name, enter **ID** and click **Add property** <br/><br/> Repeat the same steps to include **FirstName**, **LastName**, **Email**, **Address**, **Phone**, and **Mobile** (1) <br/><br/> Click on **Operations** (2) |\n| **Narration** | Let's start by defining our properties. There will be an ID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, Phone, and Mobile. As you can see, we are developing our API based on a model.  It's completely model-driven, and we've just modeled our 'Contact' object. Next we'll design and implement the operation that is related to this 'Contact' model. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-2-2-1.png) |\n\n| **2.3** | **Create operation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | On the **Select an operation to add** combobox, select **Create Contact** (1) <br/><br/> Then, click **Implement flow** (2) |\n| **Narration** | First, we select the 'Create Contact' operation. This operation syncs the data from Salesforce to Insightly CRM. Let's implement our API flow. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-2-3-1.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>3 - Implementing flow</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **Adjust response** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click on the **Response** node (1)<br/><br/>Enter **ID** in the ***ID** field (2), and select the **Request ID** object (3) |\n| **Narration** | Here we have our demo flow. In the designer flow editor, we can edit and change our flow. Before we start to create our flow, let's adjust the response. Because we will not use the API response, we can have a really simple response. We just need to have a response ID. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-0-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-0-2.png) |\n\n| **3.2** | **Retrieve contacts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click the **Plus** icon (1) <br/><br/> Search for the **Salesforce** connector (2) <br/><br/> From your pre-configured Salesforce connector, select **Retrieve contacts** (3) <br/><br/> Select **Process 10 items from the collection** (4) |\n| **Narration** | Our API will be really simple. It will retrieve the contacts from Salesforce, and then for each contact that is retrieved, we will sync the data to Insightly CRM. Let's include our pre-configured Salesforce connector and select the 'Retrieve contacts' operation. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-1-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-1-2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-1-3.png) |\n\n| **3.3** | **'For each' statement** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click the **Plus** icon (1) <br/><br/> Then, open the **Toolbox** tab (2) and select the **For each** statement (3) <br/><br/> Enter **Contacts** in the **Select the collection of items to process** field (4), and select the **Salesforce Contacts** object (5) |\n| **Narration** | Now, we need to add a 'for each' statement because we need to retrieve all the contacts from Salesforce. And for each contact, we need to create this contact in the Insightly CRM. We'll select the 'Salesforce Contacts' object as the object to be processed. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-3.png) |\n\n| **3.4** | **Create contacts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | In the **For each** loop, click the **Plus** icon (1) <br/><br/> In the **Applications** tab, search for the **Insightly** connector (2) and select the **Create contact** operation (3) |\n| **Narration** | Now we are configuring our flow to connect to the Insightly CRM. Our Insightly account is pre-configured, so we select the Create Contact operation, and mapping assist feature will start to work on background to generate some suggestions for us to populate the target field in Insightly. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>4 - Mapping assist</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **View suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Point out Mapping Assist's **22 suggestions** (1) and click **View suggestions** (2) |\n| **Narration** | In the node, you can manually define the map between Salesforce and Insightly fields. However, this is difficult because there are lots of fields, and the products might use different field names for the same objects. With Mapping Assist, you don't need to type all of these mappings. We'll use AI to simplify our work! Once the Insightly Create Contact node is added, mapping suggestions are generated. The best possible matches (top suggestions) are presented, which can be automatically inserted into fields with a single click. These top suggestions have an 80% (or higher) accuracy rate, and the count (22 suggestions) identifies the total number of fields that will be populated with mappings. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-1-1.png) |\n\n| **4.2** | **Apply suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Show the list of suggestions (1) and click **Apply 22 suggestions** (2) |\n| **Narration** | By clicking on 'View suggestions,' all suggestions with a confidence score of at least 80% are automatically displayed into the Insightly Create Contact node. Note that there are suggestions for simple fields as well as more complex, nested fields. Mapping Assist uses a pre-trained AI algorithm to provide intelligent, customized data map suggestions. From this interface, we can clear the suggestions, or we can accept and apply the suggestions. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-2-1.png) |\n\n| **4.3** | **Adjust other suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click on the **Other address postcode** field (1) <br/><br/> Select the **Other Zip/Postal Code** mapping suggestion (2) <br/><br/> Note: If you have any other field (e.g., date of birth) that is not mapped to the **For each** element (orange icon), replace it to use the **For each** element |\n| **Narration** | These 22 suggestions are the fields where the matching confidence is at least 80%, so in the background, Mapping Assist evaluates this confidence level and only fills the fields that are at least 80%. But there are also other suggestions for the other fields, and we can see these suggestions too. For example, let's see the field 'Other address postcode.' When we click on the field, we can see a suggestion to map to 'Other Zip/Postal Code' from the Salesforce Contact object with a confidence of 72%, which is lower than 80%. Let's accept this mapping. In our next run, this will be remembered by Mapping Assist, and it will show for you as one of the top suggestions. To improve accuracy in future mappings, Mapping Assist collects and stores the mapping data in an internal database by tracking your mapping history of flows that are started. For example, as you map 'Other address postcode' to 'Other Zip/Postal Code,' this mapping is remembered. Mapping Assist suggests it in future flow mappings with a 100% confidence rating, and it will be mapped any time a user chooses to insert suggestions. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-3-1.png) |\n\n| **4.4** | **Generate a transformation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | On the **Assistant name** field, click on the **Assistant's Name** mapping and select **Generate transformation** (1) <br/><br/> On the **Generate transformation** dialog, enter **John Lennon** as the first source name, and enter **J. Lennon** under **'Assistant name' examples (target)** <br/><br/> Repeat the same steps to include four more assistants' names using the same transformation format (e.g., Paul McCartney, P. McCartney; George Harrison, G. Harrison; Ringo Starr, R. Starr; Pete Best, P. Best) (2) <br/><br/> Click **Generate transformation** (3) <br/><br/> Click **Insert transformation** (4) <br/><br/> Click **Done** (5) |\n| **Narration** | If a text field is populated with a single mapping from a top suggestion or from the list of suggested mappings, but the data format of the 'source' mapping does not match the data format of the 'target' field that is populated, you can generate a JSONata expression to define how the source data should be presented in the target application. Let's explore it with the 'Assistant's Name' field. We just need to select 'Generate transformation.' The 'Generate transformation' panel opens with five blank sources and corresponding target fields that you can use for mapping data formats. We just need to provide at least five examples of source and target formats to show the preferred format for the target field. Great! Using Cloud Pak for Integration and the Mapping Assist capability, we were able to easily create a data sync between two CRM solutions without any code. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>5 - Testing your data sync</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.1** | **Checking the target contacts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Open your **Insightly** home page (1) <br/><br/> Open the **Contacts** view (2) <br/><br/> Check that there are only 21 pre-created contacts and no Babara Levy contact (3) |\n| **Narration** | Before we test our data sync flow, let's check the contacts that we have available in our target contacts. Let's open our pre-created Insightly CRM account and see the available contacts before we execute the flow. As you can see, we only have 21 pre-created contacts, and we don't have a contact named Babara Levy. After the test of our flow, we should have two or three new contacts here, and Babara Levy should be one of our contacts. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_1_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_1_2.png) |\n\n| **5.2** | **Testing the API** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Go back to Cloud Pak for Integration's **App Connect Designer** page <br/><br/> Start your flow (1) <br/><br/> Open the **Test** tab (2) <br/><br/> Click on **POST /Contact** (3) <br/><br/> Open the **Try it** tab (4) <br/><br/> Scroll down to see the body field, and click **Generate** (5) to create some dummy body content <br/><br/> Click on **Send** (6), and you should see a **201 Created** response (7) |\n| **Narration** | It is time to test our data sync. First, we need to start our flow. Now that the flow is started, let's test it. Because our flow is not using any parameters from the API request to filter the Salesforce contacts retrieved, you can use any body content to invoke our flow. Great, our data sync was executed. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_3.png) |\n\n| **5.3** | **Checking the data sync** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Go back to Insightly's **Contacts** page and refresh the page (1) <br/><br/> Explore the new contacts (without the sample_data tags) (2) <br/><br/> Click on any contact (e.g., Babara Levy) (3), and show the new format of **Assistant Name** based on the function we defined in the flow (4) |\n| **Narration** | Now let's check our new contacts. We should have at least two new contacts. These new contacts are the contacts with an 'Assistant Name.' Because the other contacts do not have an 'Assistant Name,' our transformation function will fail. The data will not be exported since we are not handling empty 'Assistant Name' fields in our function. In a real scenario, we can easily do it. Let's refresh the 'Contacts' page, and voila, here are our new contacts. Let's check the contact to see the new 'Assistant Name' format. Great! Everything works as expected. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning, data mapping is difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this demo, we showed how AI-powered Mapping Assist can alleviate these issues. We can auto-map all fields wherever the matching confidence is at least 80%, and we can process relevant and fine-grained field-level suggestions that are provided when the confidence is at least 30% and less than 80%. Note that Mapping Assist learns from these previously selected mappings, and it will show these as top suggestions when a similar source and target mapping is attempted in the future. We also generated a data transformation by providing examples of source and target data when fields do not have the same format. AI is used to determine the pattern and generate the transformation.\n\n<br/>\n\nUsing AI-powered Mapping Assist reduces development time and eliminates errors.\n\n<br/>\n\n(Demo slides [here](./Mapping-Assist-Opening-and-Closing-Slides.pptx))\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"dd525fe472d677e62fab5ea06ada9532","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1528},"frontmatter":{"title":"AI-powered low-code integration 300-level live demo","description":"custom title page","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: AI-powered low-code integration\n  300-level live demo\ndescription: custom title page\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    AI-powered low-code integration <br /> 300-level live demo\n  </span> );\n\n![banner](./images/Low-code-integration-300-Script.jpg)\n\n<span id=\"top\"></span>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Introduction</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nData mapping is among the most important design steps in building an integration flow.

We'll select the 'Salesforce Contacts' object as the object to be processed. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-2-3.png) |\n\n| **3.4** | **Create contacts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | In the **For each** loop, click the **Plus** icon (1) <br/><br/> In the **Applications** tab, search for the **Insightly** connector (2) and select the **Create contact** operation (3) |\n| **Narration** | Now we are configuring our flow to connect to the Insightly CRM. Our Insightly account is pre-configured, so we select the Create Contact operation, and mapping assist feature will start to work on background to generate some suggestions for us to populate the target field in Insightly. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-3-3-3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>4 - Mapping assist</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **View suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Point out Mapping Assist's **22 suggestions** (1) and click **View suggestions** (2) |\n| **Narration** | In the node, you can manually define the map between Salesforce and Insightly fields. However, this is difficult because there are lots of fields, and the products might use different field names for the same objects. With Mapping Assist, you don't need to type all of these mappings. We'll use AI to simplify our work! Once the Insightly Create Contact node is added, mapping suggestions are generated. The best possible matches (top suggestions) are presented, which can be automatically inserted into fields with a single click. These top suggestions have an 80% (or higher) accuracy rate, and the count (22 suggestions) identifies the total number of fields that will be populated with mappings. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-1-1.png) |\n\n| **4.2** | **Apply suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Show the list of suggestions (1) and click **Apply 22 suggestions** (2) |\n| **Narration** | By clicking on 'View suggestions,' all suggestions with a confidence score of at least 80% are automatically displayed into the Insightly Create Contact node. Note that there are suggestions for simple fields as well as more complex, nested fields. Mapping Assist uses a pre-trained AI algorithm to provide intelligent, customized data map suggestions. From this interface, we can clear the suggestions, or we can accept and apply the suggestions. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-2-1.png) |\n\n| **4.3** | **Adjust other suggestions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click on the **Other address postcode** field (1) <br/><br/> Select the **Other Zip/Postal Code** mapping suggestion (2) <br/><br/> Note: If you have any other field (e.g., date of birth) that is not mapped to the **For each** element (orange icon), replace it to use the **For each** element |\n| **Narration** | These 22 suggestions are the fields where the matching confidence is at least 80%, so in the background, Mapping Assist evaluates this confidence level and only fills the fields that are at least 80%. But there are also other suggestions for the other fields, and we can see these suggestions too. For example, let's see the field 'Other address postcode.' When we click on the field, we can see a suggestion to map to 'Other Zip/Postal Code' from the Salesforce Contact object with a confidence of 72%, which is lower than 80%. Let's accept this mapping. In our next run, this will be remembered by Mapping Assist, and it will show for you as one of the top suggestions. To improve accuracy in future mappings, Mapping Assist collects and stores the mapping data in an internal database by tracking your mapping history of flows that are started. For example, as you map 'Other address postcode' to 'Other Zip/Postal Code,' this mapping is remembered. Mapping Assist suggests it in future flow mappings with a 100% confidence rating, and it will be mapped any time a user chooses to insert suggestions. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4-3-1.png) |\n\n| **4.4** | **Generate a transformation** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | On the **Assistant name** field, click on the **Assistant's Name** mapping and select **Generate transformation** (1) <br/><br/> On the **Generate transformation** dialog, enter **John Lennon** as the first source name, and enter **J. Lennon** under **'Assistant name' examples (target)** <br/><br/> Repeat the same steps to include four more assistants' names using the same transformation format (e.g., Paul McCartney, P. McCartney; George Harrison, G. Harrison; Ringo Starr, R. Starr; Pete Best, P. Best) (2) <br/><br/> Click **Generate transformation** (3) <br/><br/> Click **Insert transformation** (4) <br/><br/> Click **Done** (5) |\n| **Narration** | If a text field is populated with a single mapping from a top suggestion or from the list of suggested mappings, but the data format of the 'source' mapping does not match the data format of the 'target' field that is populated, you can generate a JSONata expression to define how the source data should be presented in the target application. Let's explore it with the 'Assistant's Name' field. We just need to select 'Generate transformation.' The 'Generate transformation' panel opens with five blank sources and corresponding target fields that you can use for mapping data formats. We just need to provide at least five examples of source and target formats to show the preferred format for the target field. Great! Using Cloud Pak for Integration and the Mapping Assist capability, we were able to easily create a data sync between two CRM solutions without any code. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-4_4_3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>5 - Testing your data sync</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **5.1** | **Checking the target contacts** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Open your **Insightly** home page (1) <br/><br/> Open the **Contacts** view (2) <br/><br/> Check that there are only 21 pre-created contacts and no Babara Levy contact (3) |\n| **Narration** | Before we test our data sync flow, let's check the contacts that we have available in our target contacts. Let's open our pre-created Insightly CRM account and see the available contacts before we execute the flow. As you can see, we only have 21 pre-created contacts, and we don't have a contact named Babara Levy. After the test of our flow, we should have two or three new contacts here, and Babara Levy should be one of our contacts. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_1_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_1_2.png) |\n\n| **5.2** | **Testing the API** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Go back to Cloud Pak for Integration's **App Connect Designer** page <br/><br/> Start your flow (1) <br/><br/> Open the **Test** tab (2) <br/><br/> Click on **POST /Contact** (3) <br/><br/> Open the **Try it** tab (4) <br/><br/> Scroll down to see the body field, and click **Generate** (5) to create some dummy body content <br/><br/> Click on **Send** (6), and you should see a **201 Created** response (7) |\n| **Narration** | It is time to test our data sync. First, we need to start our flow. Now that the flow is started, let's test it. Because our flow is not using any parameters from the API request to filter the Salesforce contacts retrieved, you can use any body content to invoke our flow. Great, our data sync was executed. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_2_3.png) |\n\n| **5.3** | **Checking the data sync** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Go back to Insightly's **Contacts** page and refresh the page (1) <br/><br/> Explore the new contacts (without the sample_data tags) (2) <br/><br/> Click on any contact (e.g., Babara Levy) (3), and show the new format of **Assistant Name** based on the function we defined in the flow (4) |\n| **Narration** | Now let's check our new contacts. We should have at least two new contacts. These new contacts are the contacts with an 'Assistant Name.' Because the other contacts do not have an 'Assistant Name,' our transformation function will fail. The data will not be exported since we are not handling empty 'Assistant Name' fields in our function. In a real scenario, we can easily do it. Let's refresh the 'Contacts' page, and voila, here are our new contacts. Let's check the contact to see the new 'Assistant Name' format. Great! Everything works as expected. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_1.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_2.png) <br/><br/> ![](images/mapping-assist-5_3_3.png) |\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning, data mapping is difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this demo, we showed how AI-powered Mapping Assist can alleviate these issues. We can auto-map all fields wherever the matching confidence is at least 80%, and we can process relevant and fine-grained field-level suggestions that are provided when the confidence is at least 30% and less than 80%. Note that Mapping Assist learns from these previously selected mappings, and it will show these as top suggestions when a similar source and target mapping is attempted in the future. We also generated a data transformation by providing examples of source and target data when fields do not have the same format. AI is used to determine the pattern and generate the transformation.\n\n<br/>\n\nUsing AI-powered Mapping Assist reduces development time and eliminates errors.\n\n<br/>\n\n(Demo slides [here](./Mapping-Assist-Opening-and-Closing-Slides.pptx))\n\n<br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
