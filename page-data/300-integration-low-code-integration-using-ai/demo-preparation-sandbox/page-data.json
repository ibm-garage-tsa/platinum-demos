After practicing the demo you will need to reset the environment. <br/><br/>a. Delete any contacts that were added in Insightly.<br/>b. Reinstall Cloud Pak for Integration to ensure you have a clean environment. Follow the \"Request your demo environment\" instructions (step 1) from the \"Prepare to give the demo\" section above.<br/>c.

Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/mysupport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>\n\n<br/>\n\nEnsure that you have completed steps 1-6 in the **2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster** section above.\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the collapsible section to open them. Change the default values parameters using the table below.\n\n<br/>\n\nIf you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href=\"https://mailtrap.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mailtrap.io</a> account.

Open your **Cloud Pak for Integration** home page. Under **Integrations**, click **ace-designer-demo**.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-home.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n2.

Here you can see a list of the available connectors.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-connectors.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n4. Search for **Salesforce** and click **Connect**.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-salesforce-connect.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n5. Enter your Salesforce credentials here. Insert the login URL into the connector account form, as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well. It won’t work if you just copy and paste the login URL from the Salesforce screen.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n6. To populate the **Password** field on the **Connect to Salesforce** screen, you will need to concatenate the password used to log into the Salesforce account with the security token received via email. For example, if your Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the Password field.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details2.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n7. As needed in the connector account UI, use Salesforce’s Consumer Key and Consumer Secret as the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, respectively. Click **Connect**.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details3.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n8.

Paste your **API Key** (1). In the **API Version** field, keep **v3.1** (2). Click **Connect** (3).<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/prep-insightly-13.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n10. Your environment is ready to demo.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-low-code-integration-using-ai/images/prep-insightly-14.png\" width=\"800\" /><br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>5 - Reset the environment</summary>\n<br/>1. After practicing the demo you will need to reset the environment. <br/><br/>a. Delete any contacts that were added in Insightly.<br/>b. Reinstall Cloud Pak for Integration to ensure you have a clean environment. Follow the \"Request your demo environment\" instructions (step 1) from the \"Prepare to give the demo\" section above.<br/>c. Reconnect the end points, following the \"Connect Cloud Pak for Integration to your endpoints\" instructions (step 4) from the \"Prepare to give the demo\" section above.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<InlineNotification>NOTE: Attempting to reuse the same environment may result in inconsistencies between your environment and what is shown in the script and screenshots.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n**[Go to top](#top)**\n\n</details>\n\n<span id=\"alternative\"></span>\n\n<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: To complete installation using the Demo Operator, open the collapsible section below.</InlineNotification>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Alternative install option: completing demo preparation with the Demo Operator</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are a number of advantages to using the Demo Operator:<br/><br/>• You can choose to install only the demos you plan to use, reducing the install time, and simplifying your environment. <br/><br/>• Should any errors occur, you can simply delete the Demo custom resource that you have created and try creating it again, perhaps with a reduced number of demos to install. Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/mysupport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>\n\n<br/>\n\nEnsure that you have completed steps 1-6 in the **2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster** section above.\n\n<br/>\n\n1. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the collapsible section to open them. Change the default values parameters using the table below.\n\n<br/>\n\nIf you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href=\"https://mailtrap.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mailtrap.io</a> account. Mailtrap is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.\n\n<br/>\n\n| FIELD | ACTION |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| **demoPreparation:** | Set to false |\n| **demoAPICEmailAddress:** | If you’re using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use ’apicadmin@example.com’ to be safe — example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you’re using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read. |\n| **demoAPICMailServerPort:** | If you’re using mailtrap, leave this as 2525. |\n| **demoAPICMialServerUsername:** | Set this to your mailtrap username. |\n| **demoAPICMailServerPassword:** | Set this to your mailtrap password. |\n\n<br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-install-param-false.png\" width=\"800\" />\n\n<br/>\n\n2.
