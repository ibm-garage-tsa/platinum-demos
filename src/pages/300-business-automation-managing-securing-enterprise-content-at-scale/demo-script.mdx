<summary>Introduction – Not Complete</summary>

<br/>

Today I’ll show how the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation provides the capabilities needed for stakeholders to work together on millions of documents across an entire enterprise. 

<br/>

You’ll see how we automatically increase document security using role-based access, accelerate content review using video bookmarks, and streamline content creation by merging or splitting documents. 

<br/>

The scenario uses a hiring use case to demonstrate using integrated workflows to access various candidate submissions (e.g., PDFs or videos), restricting access to sensitive information, and consolidating documents, approvals, and comments from across the team.

<br/>

Let’s get started!

Action 1.2.3 Click the Candidate files folder.
 
Script13.png

Narration The HR manager uploads the various documents to the applicant’s candidate files folder. He moves the files from his computer to the folder with a simple drag-and-drop.

Narration To adhere to Focus Corp privacy guidelines, HR must prevent unauthorized access to the applicant’s personal information, such as his home address.

The HR manager uses role-based redaction to automatically mask sensitive information based on the requester's role and their need to know.
