### **WARNING**:     May 4, 2022. This demonstration’s 1-click installation occasionally fails. We have added optional instructions to use the Demo Operator for demo creation. See step 7 in the [“2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster”](#ROKSinstall) section below. Should you prefer to continue to use the original mechanism and errors occur, please raise a ticket on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> mentioning “1 click install”. We are working very closely with support, who will assist you in getting your environment running.

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | Access applications through APIs and integrations. Use Watson AI together with SaaS connectivity to Salesforce and ServiceNow to create a self-service car repair API giving customers real-time estimates and integrating directly with record systems. The demo shows easy API creation with no-code App Connect Designer, rate limiting plans, security policies and self-service API consumption using the API Connect portal. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | IBM App Connect Enterprise; IBM App Connect Enterprise Designer; API Connect (APIC) |
| **Demo guidance** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href="./300-Integration-API-Demo-Script.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

### **DEMO INSTALLATION AND SETUP**

<details>

<summary>1 - Provision a Cloud Pak for Integration environment</summary>
<br/>

Install Cloud Pak for Integration, or provision a ROKS environment. To reserve your ROKS instance, follow these steps: <br/><br/>

1. To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) ROKS 4.6 cluster on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/611bf99bd21122001e42d3fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and complete the form. (If you do not have a sales opportunity, select the purpose **Practice / Self-Education** to create a two-week reservation.)
<br/><br/>Select the "Schedule for later" option and leave the start date and time information unchanged.

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong> If there are no clusters availabile in Express installation, go ahead with the Custom installation. While the process is the same, Express is a 5 minute request (because you will receive a pre-created ROKS cluster from a queue), and custom is a 2 hour provisioning (because the ROKS cluster will be installed, behind the scenes, from scratch for you).</InlineNotification>

<br/>

2. You will receive a confirmation email confirming the instance is provisioning.<br/><br/>

3. You will receive a second email once the environment is provisioned. You should expect this to take about 30 minutes. This email contains information, such as URLs, allowing you to connect to the instance.
<br/>If you have issues connecting to your instance, please contact <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0124J683GW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#itz-techzone-support</a>.

<summary>Alternative install option: completing demo preparation with the Demo Operator</summary>

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are a number of advantages to using the Demo Operator:<br/><br/>• You can choose to install only the demos you plan to use, reducing the install time, and simplifying your environment. <br/><br/>• Should any errors occur, you can simply delete the Demo custom resource that you have created and try creating it again, perhaps with a reduced number of demos to install. Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>
