### **WARNING**:     March 15, 2022. This demonstration’s 1-click installation occasionally fails. As a result we have amended the below instructions to recommend use of the Demo Operator in order to provide a more options with regard to demo creation (see point 9 in “Create a ROKS Cluster in IBM Cloud” section <a href="https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/cp4i-demohub/cp4i-on-roks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Should you prefer to continue to use the original mechanism and errors occur, please raise a ticket on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> mentioning “1 click install”. We are working very closely with support, who will assist you in getting your environment running.

### **PREPARE TO GIVE THE DEMO**

<details>

<summary>1 - Create a ROKS cluster in IBM Cloud</summary>

<br/>

A Cloud Pak for Integration ROKS cluster can be provisioned from IBMDemos by following these steps:

<br/>

1. Access the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Tech Zone site</a> and log in using your IBM credentials.

<br/>

2. On the home page, open the **Activation kits** tab.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/request-environment-2.png" width="800" />

<br/>

3. Open the **Cloud Pak for Integration Activation Kit**.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-ak.png" width="800" />

<br/>

4. Open the **Environments** tab.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/environments.png" width="800" />

<br/>

5. Select the ROKS cluster that you want (the simplest way is to select the latest version of the Express instalation).
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/express.png" width="800" />

<br/>

6. Complete the **Create a reservation** form to define the details of your ROKS Reservation.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/reservation-form.png" width="800" />

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong> If you have any problem in Express instalation about No Cluster available, go ahead with the Custom instalation (the process is the same, however Express is a 5 minute request, because you will receive a pre-created ROKS cluster from a queue, and custom is a 2 hour provisioning, because the ROKS cluster will be installed, behind the scenes, from scratch for you).</InlineNotification>

<br/>

7. After few minutes, your ROKS environment is ready. If it is the first time that you are requesting a ROKS environment, you will receive an email to accept the invitation to join the ITZ IBM cloud account. Open the email, click **Join now** and follow the steps to accept the invitation. Your new cluster is available in this ITZ account. Take note of the account name, you will use it later to install CP4I.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/itz-account-invitation.png" width="500" />

<br/>

Now you are ready to move to the next step and install Cloud Pak for Integration.

<br/>

<details>

<summary>2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster</summary>

<br/>

1. Log in to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog</a>.

<br/>

2. Confirm that you are using the **ITZ** account.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/dte_org.png" width="800" />

<br/>

3. From the Catalog, select **Cloud Pak for Integration**.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i_catalog.png" width="800" />

<br/>

4. On **Select a deployment method**, select the version of Cloud Pak for Integration that you want/need to install. Some demos are ready for a specific version of Pak, please check in the demo page what the version is necessary.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-version.png" width="800" />

<br/>

5. Scroll down the page to the **Select your cluster** section. Select the Redhat Openshift Cluster that you just created from the list.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/roks-cluster2.png" width="800" />

<br/>

6. Click **Add project**. Enter a project name and tag name to identify your cluster.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/add-project.png" width="800" />

<br/>

7. Enter **cp4i** as Project name and click **Add**.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-project.png" width="800" />

<br/>

8. Scroll down. On the **Set the deployment values** section, uncheck the **Use an existing secret?** option to define a new password. Enter a value for csDefaultAdminPassword. It is important that you choose a password that is 32 characters in length and it conforms to the password rule - number, letter, -.

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: Currently password validation is not enforced on this page. If you proceed with an invalid password you will be able to start the installation but it will fail. There is no way to recover from this error other than provisioning a new cluster.</InlineNotification>

<br/>

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/password.png" width="800" />

<br/>

9. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the ‘twisty’ to open them. There is no need to change the default values except for the parameters that start with demo.

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>Warning</strong>: Due to issues with the current provisioning mechanism, we advise that instead of setting demoPreparation to true as described below, you instead set it to false, such that it only installs the Cloud Pak for Integration product in this step. Once this step is complete, then use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.1?topic=runtimes-deploying-cloud-pak-integration-demos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">these instructions</a> from the documentation center to complete the demo preparation using the Demo Operator.</InlineNotification>

<br/>

  There are a number of advantages to using the Demo Operator:

<br/>

•	You can choose to install only the demos you plan to use, reducing the install time, and simplifying your environment. <br/>
•	Should any errors occur, you can simply delete the Demo custom resource that you have created and try creating it again, perhaps with a reduced number of demos to install. Comparatively, if demoPreparation were set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/>
•	You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/>

<br/>

Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires familiarity with creation of custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to take the Demo Operator approach, please consider one of the following:<br/><br/>
•	Whether your demo requirements are simple enough to be satisfied by the shared environments available for <a href="https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/platinum-demos/100-integration/demo-preparation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">100 level demos</a>. <br/>
•	Continuing with demoPreparation set to true, recognising that should it fail, you will have to either raise a ticket via the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.

<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/cp4i-install-param.png" width="800" />

<br/>

If you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href="https://mailtrap.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mailtrap.io account</a>. Mailtrap.io is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.

<br/>

Fill in the following fields:

<br/>

demoPreparation: Set to ‘true’

<br/>

demoAPICEmailAddress: if you’re using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use ’apicadmin@example.com’ to be safe — example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you’re using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read.

<br/>

demoAPICMailServerPort: if you’re using mailtrap, leave this as 2525

<br/>

demoAPICMialServerUsername: Set this to your mailtrap username.

<br/>

demoAPICMailServerPassword: Set this to your mailtrap password.

<br/>

10. Accept the license agreement and click **Install** to install Cloud Pak for Integration. The installation will take up to 90 minutes.
