<summary>Introduction</summary>
<br/>
Automating customer interactions can remove manual steps, data entry into multiple different applications, and potential errors and delays – all of which are additional costs to your business. This demo automates a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, analyze the tone of the situation, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution.<br/><br/>To automate this customer interaction, we will use both APIs and integrations to back-end applications. The demo scenario is related to a car repair, but this is just an example. The same techniques are applicable to your environment in support of your customers.<br/><br/>Let’s get started!

<summary>2 - Importing the flow</summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** | **Create a flow** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | We are in the designer tooling. This is where we can create all our API integration flows and manage our connectivity to services and endpoints. Since we are just starting, there is nothing to see yet. Let’s build some integration logic and see how simple to create our flow from the Asset Repository. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **Create a flow by describing an integration**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-2-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **2.2** | **Select an asset** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration**  | Let's click the + sign to import this flow. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1 | Click the **+** sign to the right on the **Car Insurance Cognitive API Lab Short V2**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-2-2-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<summary>3 - Reviewing the flow</summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** | **Review properties** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The designer builds your API for you – you don’t need to worry about OpenAPI specs or Swagger editors – it’s all built in. These are the fields we are going to use for our API. Note that we tell our API which field is the key – in our case, **CaseReference.** |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Open the **Properties view**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Show the **Properties**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Open the **Operations** view. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.2** | **Review operations** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | In the Operations view are the actions that the API exposes along with the data. In this demo, we’re going to build just one operation: “Create Car Repair Claim”. We can add more later if we wish. Let’s check the flow logic. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | Show the **Operations view**. Click **Edit flow**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-2-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.3** | **Review the flow** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Here we have our demo flow. In the designer flow editor, we can edit and change our flow. We are a car repair company that wants to create an API that will enable customers to send us photos of their cars along with descriptions of what needs to be done with them. With this information, we will create a case in Salesforce while using Watson to analyze if the customer is angry or upset. Let’s explore our flow in detail. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Initially **close** the Request dialog. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-3-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Explain the flow and scroll through all of the connectors in the flow. Open the **Request** again by clicking the first step of the flow. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-3-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.4** | **Review request** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Our flow starts by receiving the customer’s car repair request with photo via an API. Designer automatically creates an API “request” and “response” for your API flow. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.4.1 | Show the **Request** dialog (1). Click to open the **if** step (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-4-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.5** | **Validate the photo** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Next, we validate the photo. Here, we have a simple IF statement, that checks if the PhotoOfCar is empty. If it is not empty, we move forward to retrieve contacts by connecting to Salesforce. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.5.1 | Explore the **if** step (1). Click **Salesforce Connector - Retrieve contacts** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-5-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.6** | **Retrieve contacts** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Third, we use a connector to create a case in Salesforce with the data from the API. This case is where we store the details and progress of our repair. We are using a hard-coded contact name: ‘Andy Young’. He’s the contact for the insurance company that sends customers. Salesforce Developer Accounts have a prepopulated set of data that you can use to test. ‘Andy Young’ is one of those prepopulated contacts. Let’s test our connection with Salesforce. Let me change the contact to Andrew Young and test the connection.<br/><br/> The test shows that we don’t have an Andrew Young. Let’s change it back to Andy Young and test again. We now receive a successful response. This proves that our connection is working. Let’s check the details. Here we can see the output returned from Salesforce, including the Contact ID. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.1 | Explore the **Salesforce Connector - Retrieve contacts** (1). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.2 | On the **Try this action** dialog, check **Do not show this dialog box again** (1) and click **Continue** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.3 | Change the contact **Full Name** to **Andrew Young** (1). **Test** the connection (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.4 | Change the contact **Full Name** back to **Andy Young** (1). **Test** again (2). Click the **View details** link (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-4.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.5 | On the output, open the **Contact1** object. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-5.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.6 | Close all of the dialog tabs. Click the **Salesforce – Create case** node. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-6.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.7** | **Create a case** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now that we have the ID that we need, let’s create our Salesforce case. Note that we just re-use the same Salesforce connector but with a different operation and data. Here we can see that our contact ID comes from the previous ‘retrieve contact’ Salesforce Call. The name and email address come from the API request. The connector ‘knows’ that fields like ‘Case Type’ have a limited number of values in Salesforce – so it automatically converts them into pull-down lists of values you can choose. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.7.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create case** node (1). Open the **Salesforce - Create Attachment** node (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-7-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.8** | **Create an attachment** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | To add a photograph, we need to create a Salesforce attachment. That will be easy, since we just use the connector again. Note that we use the case ID that is a returned value from the ‘Create Case’ connector call, which is kept in the flow automatically. We send the PhotoOfCar as a base64 string and we tell Salesforce that the content type is image/jpeg. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.8.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create attachment** node (1). Open the **IBM Watson Tone Analyzer** node (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-8-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.9** | **Analyze the description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The Watson Tone Analyzer service analyzes the tone of the information provided by the customer. This can identify if the customer is angry or upset, allowing us to better tailor our response. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.9.1 | Explore the **Watson Tone Analyzer** connector (1). Open the **Salesforce - Create case** comment (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-9-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.10** | **Create a case comment** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now we’ll add a comment to the case with the Salesforce connector and supply the tone name returned from Watson into the body of the comment. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.10.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create case comment** node (1). Open the **Response** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-10-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **3.11** | **Respond to the customer** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Here we have the response that we submit to the customer after the API call. This response includes their Salesforce case reference for future enquiries, an estimate of how long it will take to repair, and also how much it will cost. Now that we've built the flow, let’s start it! |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.11.1 | Explore the **Response** dialog (1). Click **Done** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-11-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<summary>4 - Testing the flow</summary>

<br/>

| **4.1** | **Start the flow** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now that we’ve looked at the integration flow, let’s start it up. When our flow is running, we need to test it. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Start the flow by clicking **turn on** at the top right. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **4.2** | **Test the flow** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | APIs can be tested in various ways, and we will perform three different tests: one in the designer tool now; another when our API is deployed to the Cloud Pak App Connect Runtime; and a final test that will call through a gateway. <br/><br/> In the Test tab, we can get all the details to test our API, for example, endpoint and credentials. And we can easily test our flow here, just need to generate a body and submit it. Voilá, we received the expected response  with the case information. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | Open the **Test** tab (1). Open **POST /CarRepairClaim** (2) and click **Try it** (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-2-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.2 | Click **Generate** (1) and **Send** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-2-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.3 | Show the **Response** details. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-2-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **4.3** | **Check Salesforce** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Let’s check our Salesforce system to see if we have a new case. Let’s open the Cases page. In the Recently Viewed section, we can check all open cases. Here we have our case with all the information, including the picture and the Watson tone analysis. With this information, our customer relationship team can support our customer. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | Open the **Salesforce Dev Account** site (1). On the **App Launcher** menu, search for **Cases** (2). Open the **Cases** page (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-3-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Edit the **demotestcar.sh** script (1). On the **Cases** view, open the latest **Car Breakdown** case. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-3-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Explore all of the fields, including picture and Watson analysis. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-3-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **4.4** | **Expose the API using the co-authoring feature** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now, let’s explore the Co-Authoring capability. The co-authoring feature enables you to simultaneously expose your API in both App Connect Designer and API Connect. When you create an API flow and then start the API in your Designer instance, the API will be automatically added to a Product, which will then be published in the Sandbox Catalog that is provided for a provider organization in API Connect. The Product also becomes visible on the Developer Portal if a site has been enabled for the Catalog. Let’s test it. Here in API Manager, we can see our API was automatically exposed from Designer, using the Co-Authoring Feature. The Product title and name are derived from the name of the originating API flow, and also include a reference to App Connect Designer. The Product version is given as 0.0.1. Later, in this demo, we will show more details about the key capabilities of API Connect to manage your API lifecycle. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.1 | Open the menu (1), and in the **Run** (2) section, select **APIs** (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-4-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.2 | In the **API Connect** page, click **Common Services User Registry**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-4-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.3 | Click the **Manage** icon. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-4-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.4 | Click the **Sandbox** catalog. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-4-4.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.5 | On the **Products** tab, you should see the published product that contains the API. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-4-5.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **4.5** | **Expose the product in the developer portal using the co-authoring feature** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The co-authoring feature enables you to test the product in the developer portal too. Let’s create our developer portal here. With the portal URL, we can check that our API Product is available. With the co-authoring feature, you have a unified authoring experience across multiple Cloud Pak for Integration capabilities. It is important to note that the API product will exist in the developer portal only while the corresponding API in App Connect Designer is still running. When you stop the API in App Connect Designer, the API product is automatically removed from the portal. The purpose of this is to simplify the unit testing while developing the flow. Later in this demo, we will show the details about the developer portal. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.5.1 | Open the **Catalog settings** (1). Click **Portal** (2). Click **Create** (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-5-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.5.2 | Select **portal-service** (1) to use for this catalog and click **Create** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-5-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.5.3 | Copy the **Portal URL**. Open a new browser tab and access the portal URL. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-5-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.5.4 | Show the **Car Insurance** API product in the developer portal home page. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-4-5-4.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<summary>5 - Deploying the flow</summary>

<br/>

| **5.1** | **Export the BAR file** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | To deploy the flow to an integration server, you must export it as a BAR file. All the configuration settings, other than the connection credentials for your accounts, are preserved in the exported archive. Let’s export an executable BAR file. From the dashboard, locate the flow, open its menu, and then click Export. When you export a flow, you can choose to export its configuration as a YAML or BAR file, or as an OpenAPI document. In our case, we export as a BAR File. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Go back to Cloud Pak for Integration and open the **Designer Dashboard** (1). Click the **Menu** (2). Click **Export** (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-5-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Select **Runtime flow asset (BAR)** (1). Click **Export** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-5-1-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **5.2** | **Create an integration server** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now, let’s open the App Connect dashboard and create a new server. We need to create an integration server to run our integration. An integration server is a Kubernetes pod which has the containers needed to run our BAR file. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Open the **Main Menu** (1). Click **Run** > **Integrations** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-5-2-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | Click **Create a server**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration/images/300-api-demo-5-2-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |

<br/><br/>

| **5.3** | **Import the BAR file** |
| :--- | :--- |

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>
Let’s summarize what we’ve done today. In the demo we: accessed the Cloud Pak for Integration environment and explored the capabilities; imported and reviewed the automated customer interactions integration flow; tested the flow; deployed the flow into the Cloud Pak runtime environment; managed access to the flow as an API and set up the security and rate limits; and demonstrated how a developer can use the API Portal to perform self-service consumption of the API.<br/><br/>From a business perspective we used APIs and application integrations to automate a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, analyze the tone of the situation, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution. <br/><br/>The customer expressing a concern or needing assistance obtains rapid response to their interaction and the confidence that your business is handling their request.<br/><br/>
