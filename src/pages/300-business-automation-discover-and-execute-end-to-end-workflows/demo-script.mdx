| **1.1** | **Introduce the refund request process without straight-through processing** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | We will look at the process diagram for Focus Corp’s refund request process in Process Designer. Within this low-code environment, the process diagram will control the execution of each refund request. The process diagram adheres to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. We use drag-and-drop to build the process diagram from the palette on the right. This allows us to model the process steps and flow. From there, you can drill down to complete the implementation and testing of the process application. <br/> <br/> Looking at Focus Corp’s refund request process, customers can initiate returns directly from the company’s portal. Currently, each request is routed to a customer service agent for resolution. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the process diagram for Focus Corp’s **Request Refund without STP** (straight-through processing) in Process Designer, which you opened during your demo preparation. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation/images/Step_1_final_screen.png" width="800" /> |
