| DEMO OVERVIEW | |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | Automate integration deployment using a cloud native approach to achieve greater productivity and simplified operations. Use an insurance quote aggregator scenario to demonstrate how the deployment of a complex integration solution can be automated using a pipeline. This demo also shows how container-based platforms enable operational consistency and automation across those capabilities, simplifying administration of an environment. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application Integration; Enterprise Messaging; API Management |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

## **DEMO INSTALLATION AND SETUP**

<details>

<summary>1 - Provision a Cloud Pak for Integration environment</summary>
<br/>

Install Cloud Pak for Integration, or provision a ROKS environment. To reserve your ROKS instance, follow these steps: <br/><br/>

1. To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) ROKS 4.6 cluster on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/611bf99bd21122001e42d3fc">here</a> and complete the form. If you do not have a sales opportunity, select the purpose **Practice / Self-Education**. Leave the start date and time  unchanged to create a two-week reservation (the maximum).

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong> If there are no clusters availabile in Express installation, go ahead with the Custom installation. While the process is the same, Express is a 5 minute request (because you will receive a pre-created ROKS cluster from a queue), and custom is a 2 hour provisioning (because the ROKS cluster will be installed, behind the scenes, from scratch for you).</InlineNotification>

<br/>

2. You will receive a confirmation email confirming the instance is provisioning.<br/><br/>

3. In approximately 30 minutes, you will receive a second email indicating the environment is provisioned. This email includes environment access information. <br/><br/>You are now ready to install Cloud Pak for Integration.

<summary>3 - Fork the GitHub repository</summary>
<br/>

This demo uses a Tekton pipeline to build images and deploy them for four App Connect integration servers and one MQ server. Now we need to fork the GitHub repository with the demo assets, including the script to create the pipeline.

<br/>

1. Open a browser and navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/cp4i-deployment-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cp4i-deployment-samples Github page</a>.
<br/><img src="./images/prepare-1-1.png" width="800" /><br/>

2. Log in with your personal GitHub account. If you need a personal GitHub account, create one <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

<br/>

3. Click **Fork**. <br/><br/><img src="./images/prepare-1-3.png" width="800" /><br/>

4. Verify that you are using **Owner** (1) you intended. Click **Create fork** (2).
<br/><img src="./images/prep-image3-4.png" width="800" /><br/>

<br/>

<InlineNotification>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Do not copy the opening or closing arrows in the command. For example, the command should look like: git clone https://github.com/ibmryan/cp4i-deployment-samples.git
</InlineNotification>

3. Open the cp4i-deployment-samples folder with this command:

<br/>

```
cd cp4i-deployment-samples

<details>

<summary>7 - Set up the parameters to install the pipeline</summary>

<br/>

We need to set up pipeline triggers by linking the GitHub repository to OpenShift pipelines. Once this is done, when you commit a change to GitHub, your OpenShift pipeline runs automatically.

<br/>

1. Set the namespace to be the correct namespace. It should be **cp4i**. On your terminal window, run this command:

<br/>

```
export NAMESPACE=cp4i
```

<br/>

2. Set the GitHub branch to **main** so the script knows which version of the GitHub artifacts to use.

<br/>

```
export BRANCH=main
```

<br/>

3. Set the GitHub repository to use as the URL of your forked repository (made in step 1).<br/>
<br/><img src="./images/prepare-5-3-1.png" width="800" /><br/>
In this example, the URL is https://github.com/rosorio/cp4i-deployment-samples.git.

<br/>

```
export FORKED_REPO=https://github.com/<your_id>/cp4i-deployment-samples.git
```

<summary>8 - Create the pipeline</summary>

<br/>

Follow these steps to create the pipeline on the OpenShift pipeline page. 

<br/>

1. In the **cp4i-deployment-samples** folder, open the **DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators folder**.

<br/>

```
cd DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators
```

<br/><img src="./images/prepare-6-1.png" width="800" /><br/>

2. Create the pipeline by running this command.

<br/>

```
./cicd-apply-test-apic-pipeline.sh -n $NAMESPACE -r $FORKED_REPO -b $BRANCH
```

<br/><img src="./images/prepare-6-2.png" width="800" /><br/>

3. Return to the OpenShift console. On the left menu, open **Pipelines**, then **Pipelines** to see what has been added.
<br/><img src="./images/prepare-6-3.png" width="800" /><br/>

4. On the **Project combo box** (1), select **cp4i** (2).
<br/><img src="./images/prepare-6-4.png" width="800" /><br/>

5. Validate there are two pipelines.

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: To complete installation using the Demo Operator, open the collapsible section below.</InlineNotification>

<details>

<summary>Alternative install option: completing demo preparation with the Demo Operator</summary>

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are a number of advantages to using the Demo Operator:<br/><br/>• You can choose to install only the demos you plan to use, which will reduce the install time and simplify your environment. <br/><br/>• Should any errors occur, you can simply delete the demo custom resource that you have created and try creating it again, perhaps with a reduced number of demos to install. Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could, for example, use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>

<br/>

Ensure that you have completed steps 1-6 in the **2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster** section above.

<br/>

1. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the collapsible section to open them. Change the default values parameters using the table below.

<br/>

If you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href="https://mailtrap.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mailtrap.io</a> account. Mailtrap is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.

<br/>

| FIELD | ACTION |

| **demoPreparation:** | Set to false |
| **demoAPICEmailAddress:** | If you’re using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use ’apicadmin@example.com’ to be safe — example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you’re using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read. |
| **demoAPICMailServerPort:** | If you’re using mailtrap, leave this as 2525. |
| **demoAPICMialServerUsername:** | Set this to your mailtrap username. |
| **demoAPICMailServerPassword:** | Set this to your mailtrap password. |
