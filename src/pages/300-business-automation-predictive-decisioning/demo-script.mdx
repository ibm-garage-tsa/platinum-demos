<summary>Introduction</summary>

<br/>

Thank you for attending this Predictive Decisioning demonstration.<br/><br/>

Today I’ll show you how IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation uses machine learning to enhance Retention offers. You will learn how to integrate Watson Studio Machine Learning with the Cloud Pak to create prediction services. These predictions are then used by automated decision services to target retention policies, lower customer retention costs, and eliminate many paper-based processes.<br/><br/>

We will see how business users can quickly get started creating and using predictions to improve their everyday processes. Data scientists will also learn ways to speed experimentation in AI development.<br/><br/>

Let’s get started!<br/><br/>

<summary>1 - Reviewing the manual call center process </summary>

<br/>

| **1.1** | **Show SkyTalk’s current manual process** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | SkyTalk is a telecommunications provider losing many of its best customers to competitors. SkyTalk needs to reduce customer churn. Let’s review the set of written customer retention policy guidelines department management implemented. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1** | Show SkyTalk’s **Retention offer document** opened during demo preparation. Discuss the problems caused by the current manual process. <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Call-center agents were asked to understand various retention offers and pick the ‘best’ option to retain the client. There were several problems with this approach.  did not work well because of the variety of reasons. <br/><br/>Agent could not factor in unique customer circumstances, and thus offers were not tailored. SkyTalk’s retention policy guidelines were implemented inconsistently by call center agents. Agents also needed to make real-time decisions while on the phone with the customer, adding time pressure. <br/><br/>The results were skyrocketing customer retention costs, while attrition remained steady.<br/><br/>SkyTalk needed is a reliable way to find the lowest cost retention offers that customer at risk of leaving would accept. SkyTalk decided to invest in an automated predictive solution.<br/><br/>This new application will leverage decision automation and machine learning to provide agents customer-specific retention offers in real-time. Machine learning will be used to analyze a customer profile to guide the decision automation in the retention offer selection. Let’s start and see how to automate the retention offer determination using business rules. |

<summary>2 - Modeling the business rules </summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** | **Review the components of SkyTalk’s retention decisions** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | A business analyst in the customer care division uses machine learning and decision automation technologies to configure the retention offer application. <br/><br/>The business analyst writes a set of business rules to generate retention offer recommendations. This set of rules is called a decision service and is shown on a decision model diagram. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Access the Business Automation Studio on the IBM Automation home page window opened during demo preparation. Then click **SkyTalk customer retention DS.**<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image34.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Click **Open**.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image36.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.3 | Click **SkyTalk Initial retention DS**.<br/><br/>**Note:** DS stands for Decision Service.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image37.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.4 | Click **Retention offer**.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image38.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The business analyst creates an automated decision, called a decision service, using a hierarchical model of business rules. Each blue box represents a sub decision. The green shapes represent the input data. <br/><br/>The ‘Determine retention offer’ decision service requires two inputs: ‘Ranked retention offers’ and ‘Retention budget’ sub decisions that both use predictions.<br/><br/>The ‘Ranked retention offers’ sub decision establishes a list of eligible offers for individual customers and calculates the cost of retention.ns required by the ‘Retention budget’ sub decision. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.5 | Review the **Retention offer decision model** after it opens.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image73.png" width="800" /> |

| **Optional Narration** | The logical upgrade policy has been expressed with a simple decision table. Each row corresponds to a specific policy condition. Moving the cursor on a row, the analyst can review the business rule in natural language. For example, the eligibility to upgrade from gold to premium is first, to be a gold member and to have a subscription usage greater than $160. |
| **Optional Action** &nbsp; 2.1.9 | Show the upgrade table decision table. Move the cursor over **row 3** to show the equivalent rule in natural language.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image204.png" width="800" /> |
| **Optional Action** &nbsp; 2.1.10 | Click **Back to the diagram**.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image205.png" width="800" /> |
| **Optional Narration** | The ‘Retention budget’ sub decision calculates SkyTalk’s maximum cost that should be spent to keep the customer. The retention budget is calculated using predictions for a customer’s lifetime value and propensity to churn.<br/><br/> The ‘Ranked retention offers’ top-level decision cycles through the list of eligible offers and selects the least expensive one that does not exceed the calculated retention budget for the given customer.<br/><br/>Now the business analyst uses IBM Watson Studio to create the two predictions required by the ‘Retention budget’ sub decision. <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image206.png" width="800" /> |

| **4.4** | **Test the customer retention decision model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The business analyst validates the ‘Retention budget’ decision calculation and retention offers recommended by the ‘Retention offer’ decision service in test mode. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.1 | Click the **“Run (3)”** tab (1) and select a **Test data** (2) from the list on the left-hand side.<br/><br/>**Note**: Do not click “Run” in the bottom right hand corner of the screenshot.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image103.png" width="500" /> |
| **Narration** | Decision outcomes are evaluated using pre-defined sample data test. Three pre-defined profiles corresponding to three customers are used for simulation. The ‘Low-value profile’ represents a customer with a very low churn risk. The expected recommendation is returned. SkyTalk sends a satisfaction survey and spends no retention budget for such customers. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.2 | Select the **Low value profile** from the drop-down list in the left-hand side.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image104.png" width="800" /> |

| **Narration** | The medium profile test also returns the expected result. The churn risk is high, so a retention offer is made. The selected retention offer has a low cost since the predicted lifetime value is low. | **Narration** |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.4 | Select the **Medium value profile** (1) from the drop-down menu on the left-hand side. Then select ** Run** (2).<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image71.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The last test is a customer with a high predicted lifetime value and a high churn risk. The decision service correctly recommends SkyTalk’s highest retention offer: an upgrade and an additional discount. The ‘Retention offer’ decision is working as expected. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.5 | Select the **High value profile** (1) and then on click **Run** (2).<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image85.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The ‘Retention offer’ decision service must now be versioned and deployed to the IBM Cloud to provide offer recommendations in SkyTalk’s call center application. Let’s now see how this works in the new SkyTalk Call Center application. |

<summary>5 - Using the automated call center application</summary>

<br/>

| **5.1** | **SGenerate a real-time retention offer that best allocates SkyTalk’s retention budget** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | We’ve seen how SkyTalk used the Cloud Pak to develop an automated call center application that provides agents customer-specific retention offers in real-time.<br/><br/> Let’s look at a how an agent handles a call from a dissatisfied customer using the new retention offer process. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Show the **SkyTalk – Call Center** application preview window opened during demo preparation.<br/><br/>**Note**: Don’t show that this application in just a preview from Application Designer since it is not in the scope of this demonstration to explain App Designer. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Enter “Peter Carter” in the **Search Customer** field (1) and click **Search** (2).<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image17.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/>**Note**: for the customer names to search for, Click the (?) next to the “search customer” label. |
| **Narration** | Immediately a customer-specific retention offer is generated. The agent can suggest this offer to the customer in real-time. This saves time, better allocate the retention budget, and helps keep SkyTalk’s best customers with the company. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Click the **Get offer** (1). Show that the offer automatically displays in the **application window** (2).<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image18.png" width="800" /> |

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>
Incorporating machine learning algorithms enhances even already automated operations.<br/><br/>

Users can build complex rulesets with many variables that precisely predict target customers. There narrow the range of costs that a business can forecast to keep a desired level of attrition. Productivity and compliance are increased thanks to automation, costs are better allocated, and customer satisfaction can be increased.<br/><br/>

Thank you for attending today’s presentation.<br/><br/>

**Note: At the end of the demonstration**<br/><br/>

To be able to follow the same scenario in your next demo, it is important to restore the demo to its initial state:<br/><br/>

1.	Un-deploy your ML service in your Watson Studio deployment environment to not be charged any more.<br/>

2.	Return in the SkyTalk initial retention DS and remove:<br/>
- The Customer Churn predictive model<br/>
- The Customer Lifetime Value predictive model<br/>
- The 2 predictions nodes in the "Retention Offer" decision model<br/>

3.	Remove the churn experiment in Watson Studio you have created if you have performed the experiment creation phase.

<summary>(Optional) 3 - Advanced extended scenario</summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** | **Creating a predictive model from a data file** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Note** | Depending on your demo objectives, you can just show the end resulting churn prediction and move on (3.1.6). This section shows how the business analyst creates a Watson ML Machine learning service. This is good material if you have the time and/or the audience is technical. It will take around 2-3 minutes to create the 8 pipelines for each prediction models. |
| **Narration** | The business analyst starts an AutoAI experiment in Watson Studio to create a new Churn prediction, referred to as a pipeline. The AutoAI tool in Watson Studio automatically analyzes real data and generates candidate model pipelines, ranking them according to the project’s objective.<br/><br/>The experiment can then train, improve, and test the candidate pipelines on real data subsets. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **New AutoAI experiment**.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image3.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | **Name** the experiment "Churn prediction 2” (1) and click **Create** (2).<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image8.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Now the analyst selects the customer loyalty data file and specifies the goal, predicting the likelihood a given customer is going to leave SkyTalk. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | Click **Select from project**.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image136.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | Select the Click “**Data asset**”(1) and then select **SkyTalk customer loyalty data.xsv** file (2). <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image9.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | During the experiment the model automatically selects and tests various algorithms. The experiment produces a set of pipelines the business analyst reviews. Then the algorithm that best fits the project’s prediction quality criteria is selected. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Click **Select asset** (1) and select the **CHURN** (2) column as the attribute to predict.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image10.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.10 | Click **Run experiment**.<br/><br/>**Note:** Make sure to wait until the computation is done.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-business-automation-predictive-decisioning/images/image89.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Watson studio automatically suggests eight different models for the business analyst to choose from to create his prediction model.<br/><br/>**NOTE**: After two minutes your eight pipelines should be ready to explore. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.11 | Return to step **3.1.7** in the main scenario script. |
