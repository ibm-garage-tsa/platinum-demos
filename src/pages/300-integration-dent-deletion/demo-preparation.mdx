| DEMO OVERVIEW | |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | Automating integration deployment using a cloud native approach, to achieve the benefits of greater productivity and simplified operations. This demo uses an insurance brokerage scenario to demonstrate how the deployment of a complex integration solution can be automated using a pipeline. This improves deployment confidence and enables faster and more frequent delivery of changes into production. It also shows how container-based platforms enable operational consistency and automation across those capabilities, simplifying administration of an environment. |
| **Demo products** | TBD - Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application Integration, Enterprise Messaging, API Management |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

## **DEMO INSTALLATION AND SETUP**

NEEDED: request your cluster as the first step

The demo preparation page is exactly equal the API demo step.

Where the first step is to request the environment

<details>

<summary>1 - Fork the Github Repository</summary>
<br/>

This demo uses a Tekton pipeline to build images and deploy them for four App Connect Integration Servers and one MQ server. In this section, you fork a github repository with all necessary assets for the demo, including the script to create the pipeline.

<br/>

1. Open a browser and navigate <a href="https://github.com/IBM/cp4i-deployment-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

2. If necessary, log in with your personal GitHub account.

<br/>

3. Click **Fork**. <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-1-3.png" width="800" /><br/>

4. Select the organization where you want to fork.

<summary>5 - Set up the parameters to install the pipeline</summary>

<br/>

We’re now going to set up pipeline triggers. We will link your GitHub repository to your OpenShift pipelines, so that when you commit a change to GitHub, your OpenShift pipeline runs automatically.

<br/>

1. Set the namespace to be the correct namespace. It should be cp4i. On your terminal window, run this command:

<br/>

```
export NAMESPACE=cp4i
```

<br/>

2. We’ll set the GitHub branch to main. Don’t worry if you don’t understand this fully – it’s telling the script which version of the GitHub artifacts to use.

<br/>

```
export BRANCH=main
```

<br/>

3. We now need to set which GitHub repository to use. It’s the URL of your forked repository that you made earlier in section 1. You can see it in your browser address bar, as seen in the image below.<br/>
<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-5-3-1.png" width="800" /><br/>
For example, ours is: https://github.com/rosorio/cp4i-deployment-samples.git. Note that rosorio is our github id, yours will be different.

<br/>

```
export FORKED_REPO=https://github.com/<your_id>/cp4i-deployment-samples.git
```

<br/>

<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/dent-deletion-1-2-1.png" width="800" /><br/>

<summary>6 - Create the pipeline</summary>

<br/>

In this section, you create the pipeline in OpenShift Pipeline page. 

<br/>

1. Back to cp4i-deployment-samples folder, open DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators folder.

<br/>

```
cd DrivewayDentDeletion/Operators
```

<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-6-1.png" width="800" /><br/>

2. Now, you are ready to create the pipeline. Run the command below to do it.

<br/>

```
./cicd-apply-test-apic-pipeline.sh -n $NAMESPACE -r $FORKED_REPO -b $BRANCH
```

<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-6-2.png" width="800" /><br/>

<br/>

3. You can check it's all there - go to OpenShift Console again, and on left menu, open Pipelines > Pipelines.
<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-6-3.png" width="800" /><br/>

<br/>

<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-dent-deletion/images/prepare-6-4.png" width="800" /><br/>

<br/>
