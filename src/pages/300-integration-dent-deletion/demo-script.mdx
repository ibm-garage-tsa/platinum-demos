<summary>Introduction</summary>

<br/>

We’re going to use an insurance brokerage scenario to demonstrate how the deployment of a complex integration solution can be automated using a pipeline. This improves deployment confidence and enables faster and more frequent delivery of changes into production. We’re also going to show how container-based platforms enable operational consistency and automation across those capabilities, simplifying administration of an environment.

<br/>

Our example scenario is an insurance broker who gathers insurance quotes from multiple different companies and provide the aggregated list to customers via an API. This example involves multiple integration styles including application integration, API management, and messaging. We’re going to build up to automated deployment and operations for the whole solution.

<br/>

Let's begin with a simple deployment of a single integration from our solution. We’ll choose one of the integrations that retrieves a quote from an insurer. We’ll then we’ll build up from there.

<br/>

We’re going to deploy our integration using cloud native techniques on containers, but we’ll show you that you don’t need to know anything about containers, Kubernetes or OpenShift (Red Hat’s Kubernetes Platform) to just deploy a simple integration.
