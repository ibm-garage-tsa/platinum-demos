### **PREPARE TO GIVE THE DEMO**

<details>

<summary>Set up and practice</summary>
<br/>

You will need to complete these steps:

<br/>

1. Register for access to the <a href="https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/registration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Center of Competency</a> (CoC).

<br/>

2. Once you get an email confirming your access credentials, go to the CoC's <a href="https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/aiops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Watson AIOps</a> cluster page.

<br/>

3. On the cluster page, you will see several clusters. You will be using the **Qui Gon** cluster.

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Watson AIOps is NOT currently multi-tenant. Therefore, only ONE USER can use the environment at a time. Otherwise, you risk overwriting/undoing other users’ demos. You must reserve your timeslot. The reservations are NOT self-enforcing, meaning it’s up to everyone to adhere to only using the demo during the time you’ve reserved and ensuring you finish up prior to the next person’s time slot.</InlineNotification>

<br/>

4.	Reserve the **Qui Gon** cluster for a self-enablement session by following the steps below:<br/>a. Click **Reservations** to access <a href="https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/calendar/qui-gon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Qui Jon's Demo Schedule</a>.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/4a.png" width="300" /><br/>b. To easily view the duration of reservations and avoid interfering with existing reservations, click **week** at the top right to access the weekly calendar view, or you can click individual reservations to see details.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/4b.png" width="800" /><br/>c. Click a date of interest in the calendar, and a reservation pop-up window will open.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/4c.png" width="800" /><br/>d. To ensure you have sufficient time to set up, practice, and clean up, reserve one to two hours (1). Choose **Self enablement** (2). You don’t need any opportunity or revenue details to use the cluster for self-enablement. Then, click **Reserve Time** (3).<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/4d.png" width="400" />

<br/>

5. In the <a href="https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/cluster/qui-gon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Qui Gon cluster details</a> page, go through the list of systems and test that you can log in to each of them with the provided credentials. <br/><br/> **Notes**: <br/> • For logging in to the IBM Automation Hub, use OpenShift as the authentication method. <br/> • The Slack channel you will use is called **#qui-gon-qotd**.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/5-cluster-details.png" width="800" />

<br/>

6. Practice the demo using the [demo script](/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/demo-script) on the next tab.

<br/>

7. Reset the demo environment by following the steps below (this process takes a minute or two to complete):<br/><br/>a. Go to **Event Manager** and click the **Open menu** icon in the top left corner (1). Then, select **Automations** (2) → **Runbooks** (3).<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-1.png" width="500" /><br/>b. Click **Run** on the row of the **Reset Ratings Service** runbook.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-2.png" width="800" /><br/>c. Click **Start Runbook**.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-3.png" width="800" /><br/>d. Click **Run**. <br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-4.png" width="800" /><br/>e. After it runs successfully, click **Complete**.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-5.png" width="800" /><br/>f. Provide feedback and rate the runbook (1). Then, click **Runbook worked** (2).<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-proactive-outage-avoidance/images/event-manager-6.png" width="800" /><br/>

<summary>Reserve your demo timeslot</summary>

<br/> 1. Go to <a href="https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/calendar/qui-gon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Qui Gon's Demo Schedule</a>. <br/><br/> 2. Click a date of interest in the calendar, and a reservation pop-up window will open. <br/><br/> 3. Fill in the details in the pop-up window and reserve your timeslot. <br/><br/>

**Notes**: <br/> • You will need a bit of time to set up prior to giving the demo (e.g., resetting the demo environment). For a customer demo, you will probably need a timeslot of at least two hours (the estimated delivery time for the demo is 30-60 minutes). You will need to reset the demo environment 15-20 minutes before your demo starts. Doing it any earlier may result in incorrect data. <br/> • Make sure to provide opportunity and revenue details.
