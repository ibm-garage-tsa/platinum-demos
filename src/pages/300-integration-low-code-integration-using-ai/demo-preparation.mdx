| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this demo, you are going to synchronize data between Salesforce and Insightly cloud CRM. You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to access them securely in the demo. <br/><br/> Both Salesforce and Insightly are CRM systems provided as a SaaS (i.e., they are hosted in the cloud). In this scenario, we will synchronize contact information data between both solutions. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration V2021.2.1 |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application Integration, Artificial Intelligence |
| **Demo guidance** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href="./AI-powered-low-code-integration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based in your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

<br/>

3. Here you can see a list of the available connectors.

<br/>

<br/>

5. Enter your Salesforce credentials here. Insert the login URL into the connector account form, as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well. It won’t work if you just copy and paste the login URL from the Salesforce screen.

<br/>

<br/>

6. To populate the **Password** field on the **Connect to Salesforce** screen, you will need to concatenate the password used to log into the Salesforce account with the security token received via email. For example, if your Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the Password field.

<summary>5 - Reset the environment</summary>
<br/>1. After practicing the demo you will need to reset the environment. <br/>a. Delete any contacts that were added in Insightly.<br/>b. Reinstall Cloud Pak for Integration to ensure you have a clean environment. Follow the "Request your demo environment" instructions (step 1) from the "Prepare to give the demo" section above.<br/>c. Reconnect the end points, following the "Connect Cloud Pak for Integration to your endpoints" instructions (step 4) from the "Prepare to give the demo" section above.

<br/><br/>

**Note**: Attempting to reuse the same environment may result in inconsistencies between your environment and what is shown in the script and screenshots.
