<br/>

5. Enter your Salesforce credentials here. Insert the login URL into the connector account form, as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well. It won’t work if you just copy and paste the login URL from the Salesforce screen.

<br/>

6. To populate the **Password** field on the **Connect to Salesforce** screen, you will need to concatenate the password used to log into the Salesforce account with the security token received via email. For example, if your Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the Password field.

<summary>5 - Reset the environment</summary>
<br/>1. After practicing the demo you will need to reset the environment. <br/>a. Delete any contacts that were added in Insightly.<br/>b. Reinstall Cloud Pak for Integration to ensure you have a clean environment. Follow the "Request your demo environment" instructions (step 1) from the "Prepare to give the demo" section above.<br/>c. Reconnect the end points, following the "Connect Cloud Pak for Integration to your endpoints" instructions (step 4) from the "Prepare to give the demo" section above.

<br/><br/>

**Note**: Attempting to reuse the same environment may result in inconsistencies between your environment and what is shown in the script and screenshots.
