### **WARNING**:     April 6, 2022. This demonstration’s 1-click installation occasionally fails. Should this occur, please raise a ticket on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> mentioning “1 click install”. We are working very closely with support, who will assist you in getting your environment running.

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this demo, you are going to synchronize data between Salesforce and Insightly cloud CRM. You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to access them securely in the demo. <br/><br/> Both Salesforce and Insightly are CRM systems provided as a SaaS (i.e., they are hosted in the cloud). In this scenario, we will synchronize contact information data between both solutions. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application integration; Artificial intelligence |
| **Demo guidance** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href="./AI-powered-low-code-integration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based in your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |
| **Required versions** | Cloud Pak for Integration V2021.2.1 |

<summary>3 - Set up Salesforce</summary>
<br/>

Now, let’s set up Salesforce. You will need a developer account to use for testing. If you already have a Salesforce developer account, you can use that. If not, you can sign up for a free developer account now.

<br/>

1. Go to <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Salesforce Developers</a>, and click **Sign Up**.<br/><br/>

<summary>6 - Reset the environment</summary>
<br/>1. After practicing the demo you will need to reset the environment. <br/><br/>a. Delete any contacts that were added in Insightly.<br/>b. Reinstall Cloud Pak for Integration to ensure you have a clean environment. Follow sections 1-2 above.<br/>c. Reconnect the end points, following the "Connect Cloud Pak for Integration to your endpoints" instructions (step 5) from above.

<br/><br/>

<InlineNotification>NOTE: Attempting to reuse the same environment may result in inconsistencies between your environment and what is shown in the script and screenshots.

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: To complete installation using the Demo Operator, open the collapsible section below.</InlineNotification>

<details>

<summary>Alternative install option: completing demo preparation with the Demo Operator</summary>

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are a number of advantages to using the Demo Operator:<br/><br/>• You can choose to install only the demos you plan to use, reducing the install time, and simplifying your environment. <br/><br/>• Should any errors occur, you can simply delete the Demo custom resource that you have created and try creating it again, perhaps with a reduced number of demos to install. Comparatively, if demoPreparation is set to true and that installation fails, you may have to start from scratch, reprovisioning the cluster.<br/><br/>• You can use this Demo operator on any Cloud Pak for Integration installation, so you are not tied to the ROKS infrastructure as you are with the current approach. You could for example use a locally installed environment.<br/><br/>Please note that use of the Demo Operator requires experience with creating custom resources in OpenShift. If you do not have the required skillset to use Demo Operator, please complete the install instructions in section 2 above. Should this fail,please raise a ticket via the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Support Portal</a> for help.</InlineNotification>

<br/>

Ensure that you have completed steps 1-6 in the **2 - Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster** section above.

<br/>

1. Scroll down to **Parameters with default values**. Click the collapsible section to open them. Change the default values parameters using the table below.

<br/>

If you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free <a href="https://mailtrap.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mailtrap.io</a> account. Mailtrap is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.

<br/>

| FIELD | ACTION |
| ------ | ------- |
| **demoPreparation:** | Set to false |
| **demoAPICEmailAddress:** | If you’re using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use ’apicadmin@example.com’ to be safe — example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you’re using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read. |
| **demoAPICMailServerPort:** | If you’re using mailtrap, leave this as 2525. |
| **demoAPICMialServerUsername:** | Set this to your mailtrap username. |
| **demoAPICMailServerPassword:** | Set this to your mailtrap password. |

<br/>

2. Once this step is complete, go <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.1?topic=runtimes-deploying-cloud-pak-integration-demos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> to complete the demo preparation using the Demo Operator. Refer to the **Mapping Assist** details.

<br/>

3. Finally, proceed to [3 - Prerequisites, preparing your environment, and delivery options](#prereq) above.
