<summary>Introduction</summary>
<br/>

Gen-Z Bank is an up-and-coming financial services providers catering mainly to millennials (?). Their main mission is to become the one-stop shop for young professionals. They provide a growing array of services, starting from educational services, financial planning, student loan processing, investments, and insurance, among others that are in the planning stages. Each of these services are supported by relatively autonomous teams. Gen-Z Bank has most of its services currently deployed to an on-prem data center. The new CEO is a big proponent of public cloud and its associated benefits of elasticity, OpEx model, and potential for costs savings. He instituted a cloud-first strategy a year or so ago, requiring all workloads to be lifted-and-shifted to the cloud within 18 months. All new workloads are required to use cloud-native principles. 

<br/>

The rising and unpredictable monthly cloud bills are beginning to get the attention of the CFO. The finance team cannot easily tell whether the costs are optimal and where and savings can be realized without risking application performance and availability.   

<br/>

Gen-Z has been looking for help and are very interested in learning how IBM can help them.

<br/>

At the very core, cloud cost optimization is about reducing the consumption of cloud resources and getting the best deal on the rate you pay for each of these resources. More broadly, a cloud cost optimization exercise will follow the following steps:

<br/>

• First, we need to get visibility into which workloads and  accounts are consuming resources and how <br/>
• Second, we can get quick wins by going after low hanging fruit by eliminating obvious waste <br/>
• Third, we need to identify over-provisioned resource, matching workloads to best fit resources types <br/>
• Fourth, seek out opportunities to minimize overpaying by leveraging discounts effectively <br/>

<br/>

Many organizations make the mistake of looking for optimization opportunities after receiving the monthly bill. It is important to understand that the above steps should be conducted continuously and in real-time to realize most gains and return on effort.

<br/>

**SCOPE OF THIS DEMO**

<br/>

Cloud cost optimization is a very broad domain. It can range from things things like refactoring monoliths to microservices, replacing expensive backend resources with their cheaper cloud provider-managed services (e.g., Oracle with PostGres), architecting to minimize data transfer costs, and establishing a tagging architecture for better governance. Topics such as these are important and relevant but considered advanced topics and better covered in a follow-on demo.

<br/>

This demo is scoped to focus only on the four core foundational aspects of a cloud cost optimization exercise.

<br/>

Many organizations make the mistake of looking for optimization opportunities after receiving the monthly bill. It is important to understand, that the above steps should be conducted in realtime and continuously to realize most gains and return on effort.

<br/>

In this demo, I’ll show you how IBM Turbonomic can help IT Ops teams get better visibility into their cloud costs, recommend areas of optimization, and derive remedial actions that can be executed from directly or fed into an external tool.

<br/>

You’ll see how IBM Turbonomic:

<br/>

• Provides visibility into the costs incurred by the various cloud workloads <br/>
• Analyzes and makes cost optimization recommendations <br/>
• Derives automatable remedial actions to drive operational cost efficiency <br/>

<br/>

Let’s get started.

<summary>1 - Visualizing dependencies and costs across your multi-cloud deployments</summary>

<br/>

| **1.1** | **Examine the cloud resource dependencies** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Cloud cost optimization starts with visualizing how your workloads are deployed across the cloud provider and building an understanding of the various cloud resources that are used to support the business applications. Turbonomic builds this resource dependency map, also called the supply chain, by introspecting the configured AWS cloud target. It builds a top-down view starting with the cloud bill and the known AWS accounts. Turbonomic also constructs a bottom-up, operational view by introspecting the resources consumed by the relevant cloud services. Let's take a closer look at the global supply chain to examine all the cloud entities in this environment. |

<br/>

| **1.2** | **Identify the top spenders** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | It is quick typical that 80% of the spend comes from a few teams. Hence, identifying these major consumers is a good place to start any cost optimization exercise. Let's explore the top spenders and their estimated monthly costs. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | View **Pending Actions**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/3-Top-Accounts.jpg" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **1.4** | **Understand where additional costs are necessary and where savings can be derived** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Cost optimization should not be done at the expense of and risk to application performance. Let's take a deeper look first into where we need to invest in cloud resources that will accelerate application performance and then into resources that are potentially over-provisioned or under-utilized that can help with realizing cost savings. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.4.1 | Examine **Cumulative Savings Charts**. <br/><br/> Examine **Necessary investments and Potential Savings**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/5-AWS-Potential-Savings.jpg" width="800" /> |

<summary>2 - Rightsizing your compute instances</summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** | **Analyze a rightsizing (downsizing) recommendation** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Cloud architects quite often make wrong choices of instance family and size with respect to the workload at hand. This can result in either performance issues or over-provisioned capacity which should be reclaimed to save costs. |

<summary>3 - Optimizing your storage volumes</summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** | **Identify and reclaim waste** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | When compute instances get deleted, the related storage volumes do not get deleted. This often results in lingering storage volumes that are adding to the cloud bill but essentially dormant. Identifying these unattached storage volumes and deleting them is considered a low hanging fruit and relatively easy way eliminating waste. <br/><br/> Turbonomic polls your your cloud volumes every 6 hours to determine if a storage volume is attached or not. <br/><br/> Let's review the unattached storage volumes and go over the potential savings computed by Turbonomic. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Action needed |

<br/>

| **3.2** | **Select the right type of storage for your workloads** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Like compute, making the right storage configuration choices is key to balancing performance and cost efficiency. These choices are hard to do in a highly dynamic environment. The analytics in Turbonomic enable the architect make and continuously improve on things like storage tier type, storage capacity, and IOPS. <br/><br/> Let's examine a storage tier recommendation. |

<summary>4 - Tracking reserved instance utilization</summary>

<br/>

| **4.1** | **Examine current reserved instance coverage** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Reservations and Savings plan can help lower the cloud bill for the relevant resource for as much 70%.  Hence, having as many workloads running under discounted pricing is certainly very desirable. Let's examine what % of workloads are being covered by RIs. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Examine RI coverage charts. |

<br/>

| **4.2** | **Examine current reserved instance inventory levels** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | A key part of cloud cost optimization is to ensure that you have the right levels of RI in your inventory. Purchasing RI's may need manual approval process hence proactively planning and ensuring that you have the right levels of inventory to cover your steady state workloads is crucial for cost optimization. On the other hand, you pay for the RI's whether you use them or not, so it is important to track RI utilization to reduce and eliminate waste. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-cloud-cost-optimization/images/10-RI-1.jpg" width="800" /> |

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>

While cost optimization is important it should not be done at the expense of application performance. GenZ can leverage the Turbonomic platform to get a deeper visibility into their cloud deployment. They can use platform-generated analytics to identify and eliminate waste, optimize compute instances, right-fit storage layer architectural choices, and automate the execution of these analytics where appropriate - to ensure their deployments are always available, performant, and cost-optimized.
