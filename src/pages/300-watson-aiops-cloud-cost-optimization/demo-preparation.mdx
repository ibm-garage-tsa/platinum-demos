<summary>Scope of this demo</summary>
<br/>

Cloud cost optimization is a very broad domain. It can range from things things like refactoring monoliths to microservices, replacing expensive backend resources with their cheaper cloud provider-managed services (e.g., Oracle with PostGres), architecting to minimize data transfer costs, and establishing a tagging architecture for better governance. Topics such as these are important and relevant but considered advanced topics and better covered in a follow-on demo.

<br/>

This demo is scoped to focus only on the four core foundational aspects of a cloud cost optimization exercise.
