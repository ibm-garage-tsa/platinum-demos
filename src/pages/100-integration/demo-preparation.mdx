| DEMO OVERVIEW | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | Access applications through APIs and integrations. This demo automates a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern; open a case in Salesforce; attach the incoming information to the case; analyze the tone of the situation, and; respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution.<br/><br/>To automate this customer interaction, we will use both APIs and integrations to back-end applications. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration V2021.1 |
| **Demo capabilities** | IBM App Connect Enterprise, IBM App Connect Enterprise Designer, API Connect (APIC) |
| **Demo guidance** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href="./100-Integration-Demo-Script.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see (**Screenshots**).<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. <br/><br/> *You are using a shared demo environment with multiple sellers at the same time. Please don't create custom flows or APIs in this environment. Don't do any customization (including customer names). Please just follow the steps. If you need to do a customized demo, please select the 300 demo option.* |
