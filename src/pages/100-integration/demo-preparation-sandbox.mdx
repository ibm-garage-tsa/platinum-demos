### **WARNING**:     There are currently issues with the North America cluster. When reserving your cluster in step 1.2 below, please elect the Europe (EU) cluster.

| DEMO OVERVIEW | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | Access applications through APIs and integrations. This demo automates a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern; open a case in Salesforce; attach the incoming information to the case; analyze the tone of the situation, and; respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution.<br/><br/>To automate this customer interaction, we will use both APIs and integrations to back-end applications. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | IBM App Connect Enterprise; IBM App Connect Enterprise Designer; API Connect (APIC) |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. <br/><br/> You are using a shared demo environment with multiple sellers at the same time. Please don't create custom flows or APIs in this environment. Also, don't do any customization (including customer names). Please just follow the steps. If you need to do a customized demo, please select the 300-level demo option. |

### **PREPARE TO GIVE THE DEMO**

<summary>1 - Provision a Cloud Pak for Integration environment</summary>
<br/>

Install Cloud Pak for Integration, or provision a ROKS environment. To reserve your ROKS instance, follow these steps: <br/><br/>

1. To reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) ROKS 4.6 cluster on Red Hat OpenShift, go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/611bf99bd21122001e42d3fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and complete the form. (If you do not have a sales opportunity, select the purpose **Practice / Self-Education** to create a two-week reservation.)

<br/>

<InlineNotification><strong>NOTE</strong> If there are no clusters availabile in Express installation, go ahead with the Custom installation. While the process is the same, Express is a 5 minute request (because you will receive a pre-created ROKS cluster from a queue), and custom is a 2 hour provisioning (because the ROKS cluster will be installed, behind the scenes, from scratch for you).</InlineNotification>

<br/>

2. You will receive a confirmation email confirming the instance is provisioning.<br/><br/>

3. You will receive a second email once the environment is provisioned. You should expect this to take about 30 minutes. This email contains information, such as URLs, allowing you to connect to the instance.
<br/>If you have issues connecting to your instance, please contact <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0124J683GW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#itz-techzone-support</a>.
