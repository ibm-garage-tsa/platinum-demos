### **DEMO INSTALLATION**

<details>

<summary>1 - Request a demo instance </summary>

<br/>

To request access to a demo instance via Techzone for 75 minutes of access, follow these steps: <br/><br/>

1. Go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/64027512b90e3000171bc0a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and complete the form.

<br/>

**Purpose**: Select **Customer Demo** if presenting to a customer, or **Practice/Self-Education** if you are practicing the demonstration.<br/><br/>

**Purpose description**: Provide a brief description of why you need access to the demo instances.<br/><br/>

**Preferred Geography**: Select any option. This setting has no bearing on access to the demo instances.<br/><br/>

**End date and time**: The default time (and max time) is 75 minutes. <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-using-finops-to-manage-cost-on-public-cloud/images/turbonomic-prep-reservation.png" width="800" />

<br/>

2. Click **Submit**. In less than a minute, you should receive an email confirming your access is being provisioned.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-using-finops-to-manage-cost-on-public-cloud/images/turbonomic-prep-reservation-email-confirmation.png" width="800" />

<br/>

3. Within a 1-2 minutes of receiving that email, you should have access to the demo instances. You do not need to wait to receive the second email, titled Ready. The list of Demo instances is available in the table above.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-using-finops-to-manage-cost-on-public-cloud/images/turbonomic-prep-reservation-ready.png" width="500" />

4. After 75 minutes, your access to the Demo Instances will be removed. You will receive the following email.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-using-finops-to-manage-cost-on-public-cloud/images/turbonomic-prep-reservation-deleted.png" width="500" />

<br/><br/>

Repeat these whenever you need access again.

<InlineNotification>TechZone has made changes to the process for accessing Turbonomic. If you have back-to-back Customer Demos you will need to re-request access after 75 minutes. To minimize disruption, you can schedule access to demo instances ahead of time. In step 2 (above), select Schedule instead of Reserve Now to choose a future 75 minute window. Be sure to set your start time to one minute after your previous reservation expires. For example: If Reservation 1 is from 9:00-10:15 (75 mins), schedule Reservation 2 to start at 10:16.</InlineNotification>
