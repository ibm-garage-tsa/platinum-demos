Turbonomic analysis indicates that the worker node currently hosting the rabbitmq service is under-utilized and operational efficiency can be further improved by moving this service to another worker node and in that process consolidating the cluster resources on fewer worker nodes. The analytics also computes the approximate future resource utilization rates of the source and target worker nodes if the actions were to be taken. In the absence of these capabilities the alternate manual approach can be slow, reactive, error-prone and increasingly challenging as the number of services on the cluster grow.",Object(o.b)("br",null),Object(o.b)("br",null),"Last but not least, the analytics also inform the user whether these resource optimization actions can be taken right from within Turbonomic.
